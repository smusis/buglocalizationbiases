crank up faceting module tests



Description:
The faceting module has a large set of good tests.

lets switch them over to use all of our test infra (randomindexwriter, random iwconfig, mockanalyzer, newDirectory, ...)
I don't want to address multipliers and atLeast() etc on this issue, I think we should follow up with that on a separate issue, that also looks at speed and making sure the nightly build is exhaustive.

for now, lets just get the coverage in, it will be good to do before any refactoring.
