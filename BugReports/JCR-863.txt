Use FileLock for locking instead of empty file



Description:
The FSDirectory uses File.createNewFile to effectively lock a directory (in makeLock), yet the Java Spec says explcitly not to use it for this purpose, and instead use FileLock from nio.

The attached patch shows how this is/could be done (change is internal to the makeLock method only, and functionally equivalent, the same tests apply).
