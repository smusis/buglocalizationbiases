IndexingQueue not checked on initial index creation



Description:
With a default value of 100 for extractorBackLogSize and lots of text extractions that time out, the temp folder gets filled with extractor*.tmp files. This is because the IndexingQueue.getFinishedDocuments() is not called during the initial index creation. This is not an issue during regular operation because the method is called periodically from a timer thread.
