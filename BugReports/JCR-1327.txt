SPI POM improvements



Description:
While the SPI components were upgraded from the sandbox I didn't pay too much attention to the POM details and thus there still are a number of configuration entries that duplicate stuff from the Jackrabbit parent POM, etc.

I plan to get rid of any such duplication, remove some unneeded dependencies (spi-commons has a compile scope dependency on junit) and generally update the POMs to be in line with the other release components.
