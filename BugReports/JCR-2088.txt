Drop Maven 1 compatibility



Description:
We migrated from Maven 1 to Maven 2 as the build system in Jackrabbit 1.2, but we kept compatibility with related Maven 1 build with the maven-one-plugin that deployed all builds also to the local Maven 1 repository.

Hardly any downstream project uses Maven 1 anymore, so it's safe for us to simplify our build now by dropping the use of the maven-one-plugin.
