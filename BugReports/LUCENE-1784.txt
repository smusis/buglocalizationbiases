Make BooleanWeight and DisjunctionMaxWeight protected



Description:
Currently, BooleanWeight is private, yet it has 2 protected members (similarity, weights) which are unaccessible from custom code

i have some use cases where it would be very useful to crawl a BooleanWeight to get at the sub Weight objects

however, since BooleanWeight is private, i have no way of doing this

If BooleanWeight is protected, then i can subclass BooleanQuery to hook in and wrap BooleanWeight with a subclass to facilitate this walking of the Weight objects

Would also want DisjunctionMaxWeight to be protected, along with its "weights" member

Would be even better if these Weights were made public with accessors to their sub "weights" objects (then no subclassing would be necessary on my part)

this should be really trivial and would be great if it can get into 2.9

more generally, it would be nice if all Weight classes were public with nice accessors to relevant "sub weights"/etc so custom code can get its hooks in where and when desired
