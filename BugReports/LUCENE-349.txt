Documentation for tii and tis files seems to be out of sync with code



Description:
The documentation on the .tii file in fileformats.xml seems to be out of sync
with the actual code in TermInfosReader.java.

Specifically, the docs for the TermInfosIndex file seems to leave out several
fields that are read from the file in the readIndex() method (well, specifically
they're read in by the SegmentTermEnum constructor, but you get the idea).
