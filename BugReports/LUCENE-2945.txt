Surround Query doesn't properly handle equals/hashcode



Description:
In looking at using the surround queries with Solr, I am hitting issues caused by collisions due to equals/hashcode not being implemented on the anonymous inner classes that are created by things like DistanceQuery (branch 3.x, near line 76)
