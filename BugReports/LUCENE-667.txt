javacc skeleton files not regenerated



Description:
Copies of the the character stream files for javacc are checked into svn. These files were generated under javacc 3.0 (at least that's what they say, though javacc 3.2 says this too). javacc 4 complains that they are out of date but won't replace them; they must be removed before it will regenerate them.

There is one side effect of removing them: local changes are lost.  r387550 removed a couple of deprecated methods. By using the files as generated by javacc, these deprecated  methods will be readded (at least until the javacc team removes them totally). There are other changes being made to the stream files, so I woudl think it's better to live with them unmodified than to keep local versions just for this change.

If we want javacc to recreate the files, the attached patch will remove them before running javacc.

All the tests pass using both javacc3.2 and 4.0.
