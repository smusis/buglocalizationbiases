Cache jcr name to QName mappings



Description:
Currently jcr names are always parsed and resolved into QName instances. Introducing a cache would increase performance and also save memory because well known and often used jcr names would always return the same QName instance from cache.

Testing with common read operations shows a performance improvement of about 25%.
The test involved the following methods on Node interface:

- getProperty()
- getProperties()
- getName()
- getPath()
- isLocked()
- isNodeType()
- getPrimaryNodeType()
- hasNodes()
- getNodes()

Attached proposed implementation of a QNameResolver.

Please comment.
