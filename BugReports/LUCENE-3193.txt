TwoPhaseCommit interface



Description:
I would like to propose a TwoPhaseCommit interface which declares the methods necessary to implement a 2-phase commit algorithm:
* prepareCommit()
* commit()
* rollback()

The prepare/commit ones have variants that take a (Map<String,String> commitData) following the ones we have in IndexWriter.

In addition, a TwoPhaseCommitTool which implements a 2-phase commit amongst several TPCs.

Having IndexWriter implement that interface will allow running the 2-phase commit algorithm on multiple IWs or IW + any other object that implements the interface.

We should mark the interface @lucene.internal so as to not block ourselves in the future. This is pretty advanced stuff anyway.

Will post a patch soon
