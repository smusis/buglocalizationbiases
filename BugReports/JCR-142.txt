allow subclassing of NodeTypeReader



Description:
in working towards an offline tool to import custom namespaces and node types, i found that i needed to make some small changes to NodeTypeReader and DOMWalker so that i could subclass NodeTypeReader and access the namespaces specified in the node type definition file. see the attached patch.
