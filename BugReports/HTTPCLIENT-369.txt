Missing skip()-Method in ContentLengthInputStream



Description:
ContentLengthInputStream is missing the skip()-Method.

This causes the internal pos variable to get out of sync with the content 
length. 
We oberseved that closing the stream caused a wait time of about 15 sec in 
routines which use the skip()-method of InputStream.

Here's a possible implementation which should solve the problem:

    public long skip(long len) throws IOException {
        long count = super.skip(len);
        pos += count;
        return count;
    }
