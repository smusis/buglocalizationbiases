Add <a name=""> anchors to documentation sections



Description:
In all docs, sections are missing <a name> anchors. I see that the xdocs stylesheet in the repository is supposed to generate them, yet the site is missing them at this moment.

See https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/site/xdocs/stylesheets/site.xsl 
template match="section"
