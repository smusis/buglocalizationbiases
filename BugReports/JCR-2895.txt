SessionImpl#getSubject() should return an unmodifiable subject



Description:
for security reasons the subject exposed by SessionImpl#getSubject() should be unmodifiable or at least changes made
to it should not be modify the subject hold by the session.

currently i see the following options to get there:
a: set readonly flag on the subject associated with the session
b: getSubject() returns a new instance of Subject having the same characteristics as the subject associated with the session
c: getSubject() returns a new but readonly Subject instance

my preferred solution was c as
- it doesn't change the characteristics of the subject
- the unmodifiable status is transparent to the caller since modifying the subject fails without forcing the api consumer
  to read the javadoc to know why changing the subject is not reflected on the session itself (that would be a drawback of b).
