IndexReader subclasses must implement flex APIs



Description:
To be fixed only on trunk...

I made IndexReader's base flex APIs abstract, fixed all core/contrib/solr places that subclassed IR and didn't already implement flex (including contrib/memory, contrib/instantiated), and remove all the classes for the back-compat layer that emulated flex APIs on top of pre-flex APIs.
