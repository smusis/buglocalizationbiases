Add simple query method to ObjectContentManager



Description:
As discussed in [1], I suggest a new method 

    ObejctContentManager.getObjectIterator(String query, String language)

to easily query the repository for objects using a predefined query. (I chose getObjectIterator instead of getObjects as I intend the method to return an Iterator and not a Collection)
