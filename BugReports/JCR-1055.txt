Incorrect node position after import



Description:
I have found a behavior that does not seem to be consistent with the
spec:

After replacing a node with importXML using IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING the new node is not at the position of the replaced node (talking about the position among the siblings).

The origininal node is removed, but the new node is created as the last child of the parent node, and not spec-compliant at the position of the replaced node.

Here how I use it:

// assume Session s, Node n, String text (holding XML data)

s.importXML(
	n.getPath(), 
	new ByteArrayInputStream (text.getBytes("UTF-8")),
	ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING
);
s.save();
 

And here a quote from the spec section 7.3.6

ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING: 
If an incoming referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing in the workspace then the already existing node is replaced by the incoming node in the same position as the existing node.
[note "same position"]
