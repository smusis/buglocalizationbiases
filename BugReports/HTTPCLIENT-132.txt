New Preferences Architecture



Description:
An architectural solution is needed to configure various aspects of HttpClient,
Methods and Connections. 

Features:
- can configure certain properties per request / per connection
- all configuration is done in a consistant way 
- do not use system properties
- configuration is completely optional: default values should be used if no
configuration is made

This is a refactoring request / reminder. File configuration issues as
dependencies of this bug.
