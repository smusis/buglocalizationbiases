Cookie Strict Mode independent of regular Strict Mode



Description:
Hi,

I'm having a problem where a web site I'm trying to access is using strict 
cookies (on one line) and a 302 redirect that fails in strict mode.  So I 
cannot access this website because in strict mode it fails because of the 302 
redirect and in non-strict mode the website doesn't recognize the Cookies on 
separate lines.

I'd love to see this added for the next release candidate.

Thanks,

Brent
