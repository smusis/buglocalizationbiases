[PATCH] BitSetQuery, FastPrefixQuery, FastWildcardQuery and FastQueryParser



Description:
FastPrefixQuery and FastWildcardQuery rewrites to BitSetQuery instead of OR'ed
BooleanQuery's.  A BitSetQuery contains a BitSet that desginates which document
should be included in the search result.  BitSetQuery cannot be used by itself
with MultiSearcher as of now.
