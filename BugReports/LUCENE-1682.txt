unit tests should use private directories



Description:
This only affects our unit tests...

I run "ant test" and "ant test-tag" concurrently, but some tests have false failures (eg TestPayloads) because they use a fixed test directory in the filesystem for testing.

I've added a simple method to _TestUtil to get a temp dir, and switched over those tests that I've hit false failures on.
