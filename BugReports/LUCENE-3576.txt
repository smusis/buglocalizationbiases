TestBackwardsCompatibility needs terms with U+E000 to U+FFFF



Description:
we changed sort order in 4.0, and have sophisticated backwards compatibility (e.g. surrogates dance),
but we don't test this at all in TestBackwardsCompatibility.

for example, nothing handles this case for term vectors...
