add ability to not count sub-task doLogic increment to contri/benchmark



Description:
Sometimes, you want to run a sub-task like CloseIndex, and include the time it takes to run, but not include the count that it returns when reporting rec/s.

We could adopt this approach: if a task is preceded by a "-" character, then, do not count the value returned by doLogic.
