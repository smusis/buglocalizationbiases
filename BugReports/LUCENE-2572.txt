Maven artifacts for Lucene 4 are not stored in the correct path



Description:
Hello,

I would like to use the maven artifacts for Lucene 4.0 produced by the Hudson build machine. The artifacts are correctly produced (http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Lucene/job/Lucene-trunk/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/maven_artifacts/lucene/).
However, the artifacts which should be stored under the path "org/apache/lucene/" are currently stored under "lucene" which prevents a project using maven to correctly download the Lucene 4.0 artifacts.

Thanks again for your help.
