InvalidQueryException thrown for a SQL query using WHERE CONTAINS(., 'someword')



Description:
The following SQL query:
SELECT * FROM es:document WHERE CONTAINS(., 'software')
throws an InvalidQueryException exception.

javax.jcr.query.InvalidQueryException: Encountered "." at line 1, column 42.
Was expecting one of:
    "BY" ...
    "IN" ...
    "OR" ...
    "IS" ...
    "AND" ...
    "LIKE" ...
    "NULL" ...
    "FROM" ...
    "ORDER" ...
    "WHERE" ...
    "SELECT" ...
    "BETWEEN" ...
    "*" ...
    <REGULAR_IDENTIFIER> ...
    <DELIMITED_IDENTIFIER> ...
    
This syntax seems correct according to the latest jcr spec (1.0.1).
Using an asterisk (*) instead of a dot (.) as the first parameter of CONTAINS() works fine.
