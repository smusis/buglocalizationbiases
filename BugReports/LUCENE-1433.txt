Changes.html generation improvements



Description:
Bug fixes for and improvements to changes2html.pl, which generates Changes.html from CHANGES.txt:

# When the current location has a fragment identifier, expand parent sections, so that the linked-to section is visible.
# Properly handle beginning-of-release comments that don't fall under a section heading (previously: some content in release "1.9 final" was invisible).
# Auto-linkify SOLR-XXX and INFRA-XXX JIRA issues (previously: only LUCENE-XXX issues).
# Auto-linkify Bugzilla bugs prefaced with "Issue" (previously: only "Bug" and "Patch").
# Auto-linkify Bugzilla bugs in the form "bugs XXXXX and YYYYY".
# Auto-linkify issues that follow attributions.
