Problems with BundleDbPersistenceManager getAllNodeIds



Description:
When using MySQL:
The problem arises when the method parameter maxcount is less than the total amount of records in the bundle table.

First of all I found out that mysql orders the nodeid objects different than jackrabbit does. The following test describes this idea:

    public void testMySQLOrderByNodeId() throws Exception {
        NodeId nodeId1 = new NodeId("7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37");
        NodeId nodeId2 = new NodeId("9fd0d452-b5d0-426b-8a0f-bef830ba0495");

        PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT NODE_ID FROM DEFAULT_BUNDLE WHERE NODE_ID = ? OR NODE_ID = ? ORDER BY NODE_ID");

        Object[] params = new Object[] { nodeId1.getRawBytes(), nodeId2.getRawBytes() };
        stmt.setObject(1, params[0]);
        stmt.setObject(2, params[1]);

        ArrayList<NodeId> nodeIds = new ArrayList<NodeId>();
        ResultSet resultSet = stmt.executeQuery();
        while(resultSet.next()) {
            NodeId nodeId = new NodeId(resultSet.getBytes(1));
            System.out.println(nodeId);
            nodeIds.add(nodeId);
        }
        Collections.sort(nodeIds);
        for (NodeId nodeId : nodeIds) {
            System.out.println(nodeId);
        }
    }

Which results in the following output:

7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37
9fd0d452-b5d0-426b-8a0f-bef830ba0495
9fd0d452-b5d0-426b-8a0f-bef830ba0495
7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37


Now the problem with the getAllNodeIds method is that it fetches an extra 10 records on top of maxcount (to avoid a problem where the first key is not the one you that is wanted). Afterwards it skips a number of records again, this time using nodeid.compareto. This compareto statement returns true unexpectedly for mysql because the code doesn't expect the mysql ordering.

I had the situation where I had about 17000 records in the bundle table but consecutively getting the ids a thousand records at a time returned only about 8000 records in all.
