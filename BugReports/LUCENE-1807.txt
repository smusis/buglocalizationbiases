Add convenient constructor to PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper for Dependency Injection



Description:
It would be good if PerFieldAnalyzerWrapper had a constructor which took in an analyzer map, rather than having to repeatedly call addAnalyzer -- this would make it much easier/cleaner to use this class in e.g. Spring XML configurations.

Relatively trivial change, patch to be attached.
