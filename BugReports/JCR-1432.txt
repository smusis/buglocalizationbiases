Saving a node deletion that has been modified externally throws a ConstraintViolationException



Description:
Deleting a node "a" and saving its parent might result in a ConstraintViolationException if node "a" has been modified externally, where an InvalidItemStateException with message "item x has been modified externally" would be more intuitive.
