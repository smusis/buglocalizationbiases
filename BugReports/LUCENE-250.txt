Javadocs for Scorer.java and TermScorer.java



Description:
Javadocs for Scorer.java and TermScorer.java 
Also changed build.xml to use package access for the 
javadocs target. That caused some minor error javadoc messages 
in CompoundFileReader.java and FieldInfos.java, which are also fixed. 
 
The patch posted earlier for Weight.java 
(a broken javadoc link) is also included. 
 
The attached patch is for all 5 files against the CVS top directory 
of 28 July 2004. The only dependency is that package access 
is needed for TermScorer.java. 
 
This might be changed by declaring TermScorer as a public class, 
but I preferred to use javadoc package access in build.xml 
over changing java code. 
 
Using package access for javadocs shows some more undocumented 
classes, eg. in the doc page of the search package. This might 
encourage folks to write more javadocs...
