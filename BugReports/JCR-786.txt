OracleBundlePersistenceManager needs special blob handling for JDBC drivers prior to oracle 10



Description:
the new oracle bundle persistence manager (see JCR-755) needs special blob handling for oracle jdbc drivers prior to version 10. since the pm works for newer versions, i suggest to add a separate pm eg: Oracle9PersistenceManager that contains this special blob handling.
