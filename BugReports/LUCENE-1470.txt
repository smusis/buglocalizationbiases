Add TrieRangeFilter to contrib



Description:
According to the thread in java-dev (http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/67807 and http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/67839), I want to include my fast numerical range query implementation into lucene contrib-queries.

I implemented (based on RangeFilter) another approach for faster
RangeQueries, based on longs stored in index in a special format.

The idea behind this is to store the longs in different precision in index
and partition the query range in such a way, that the outer boundaries are
search using terms from the highest precision, but the center of the search
Range with lower precision. The implementation stores the longs in 8
different precisions (using a class called TrieUtils). It also has support
for Doubles, using the IEEE 754 floating-point "double format" bit layout
with some bit mappings to make them binary sortable. The approach is used in
rather big indexes, query times are even on low performance desktop
computers <<100 ms (!) for very big ranges on indexes with 500000 docs.

I called this RangeQuery variant and format "TrieRangeRange" query because
the idea looks like the well-known Trie structures (but it is not identical
to real tries, but algorithms are related to it).
