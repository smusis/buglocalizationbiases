Non-standards configuration and tracking



Description:
A simple strict or setLenient is likely inadequate.  Each particular
non-standard behaviour should be tagged, and settable from the client.  A mask
for particular behavioural features could be provided, with STRICT meaning none
and LENIENT meaning all.
