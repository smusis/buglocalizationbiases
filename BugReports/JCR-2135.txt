UserManagement: make membership a weakreferences



Description:
the 2.0 user management code still contains a TODO asking for changing group-membership from reference to weakreference. 

now that weakreferences are implemented in jackrabbit-core i'd like to make that change both in the node type definitions and the code.

i'm opening this issue in order to give us the chance to keep track of node type change that may cause troubles....
