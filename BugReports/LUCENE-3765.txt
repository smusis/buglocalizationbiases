trappy ignoreCase behavior with StopFilter/ignoreCase



Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-3751:

{code}
* If <code>stopWords</code> is an instance of {@link CharArraySet} (true if
* <code>makeStopSet()</code> was used to construct the set) it will be
* directly used and <code>ignoreCase</code> will be ignored since
* <code>CharArraySet</code> directly controls case sensitivity.
{code}

This is really confusing and trappy... we need to change something here.
