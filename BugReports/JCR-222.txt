incompatible with newers versions of xml-apis



Description:
Apparently the newer version of the xml-api does not play nice with file objects passed in via a streamresult. So to get around this, I have modified the jackrabbit code RepositoryConfig.java:311 to read:
 
               transformer.transform(
                    //new DOMSource(template), new StreamResult(xml)); COMMENTED OUT! 
                    new DOMSource(template), new StreamResult(directory+"\\"+WORKSPACE_XML));

A similar issue can be found here: http://forum.java.sun.com/thread.jspa?forumID=34&threadID=563077 and a somewhat similar issue can be found logged as a bug at sun: http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=5077403
