SQLException with OracleBundle PM in name index



Description:
The oracle bundle pm shows errors like:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: Unable to insert index: java.sql.SQLException:  
  ORA-01400: cannot insert NULL into  ("MARTIJNH"."WM9_VERSIONING_PM_NAMES"."ID")

this is due to the fact that oracle treats empty strings as NULL values which does the schema not allow.
