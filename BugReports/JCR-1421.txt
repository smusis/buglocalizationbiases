Backport JCR-1111: Accesss to version history results in reading all versions of versionable node



Description:
Backport issue JCR-1111 (Accesss to version history results in reading all versions of versionable node) to 1.3 branch for 1.3.4 (separate issue to avoid re-opening JCR-1111 which was already released with 1.4).
