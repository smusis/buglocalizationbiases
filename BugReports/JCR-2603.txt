DefaultLoginModule performs anonymous login in case of unsupported Credentials implementation



Description:
If Repository.login in called with an unsupported Credentials implementation the DefaultLoginModule#getCredentials returns null
and thus an anonymous login. The expected behavior from my point of view however was, that login with unsupported credentials 
would not be handled by the LoginModule and - if no other module is able to handle it -  login would consequently fails.
