Determination of property state difference should skip binary values



Description:
o.a.j.jcr2spi.state.PropertyState.diffPropertyData, PropertyData) should alway consider two binary values to be different. The current implementation compares two binary values with equals(). An implementation will in general have to do a byte by byte comparison of both values. This is most likely always more expensive than considering the values different right from the start.
