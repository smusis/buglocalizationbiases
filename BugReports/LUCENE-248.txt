[PATCH] Add StopFilter ignoreCase option



Description:
Wanted to have the ability to ignore case in the stop filter.  In some cases, I
don't want to have to lower case before passing through the stop filter, b/c I
may need case preserved for other analysis further down the stream, yet I don't
need the stopwords and I don't want to have to apply stopword filters twice.
