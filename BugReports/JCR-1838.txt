Garbage collection deletes temporary files in FileDataStore



Description:
In FileDataStore.addRecord(InputStream), a temporary file is created. The data is written to the file and then it is moved to its final location (based on the contents hash).

If the garbage collector runs whilst this temp file is present, it deletes it (on Solaris 10 at least), and the addRecord fails at the attempt to rename the now non-existent temp file.

I am attaching a minimal patch that prevents these temp files being deleted by deleteOlderRecursive(..), regardless of their lastModified() value.

I have made this a Minor priority, since there is the obvious workaround of disabling the GC.
