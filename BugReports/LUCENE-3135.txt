backport suggest module to branch 3.x



Description:
It would be nice to develop a plan to expose the autosuggest functionality to Lucene users in 3.x

There are some complications, such as seeing if we can backport the FST-based functionality,
which might require a good bit of work. But I think this would be well-worth it.
