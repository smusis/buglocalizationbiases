Correct spatial and trie documentation links in JavaDocs and site



Description:
After updating myself in the site docs, I have some changes to the site and javadocs of Lucene 2.9:
- Add spatial contrib to javadocs
- Add trie package to the contrib/queries package
Both changes prevent these pacakges from a apearing in core's pacakge list on the javadocs/all homepage. I also adjusted the documentation page to reflect the changes.

I will commit the attached patch, if nobody objects.
