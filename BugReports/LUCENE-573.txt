Escaped quotes inside a phrase cause a ParseException



Description:
QueryParser cannot handle escaped quotes when inside a phrase. Escaped quotes not in a phrase are not a problem. This can be added to TestQueryParser.testEscaped() to demonstrate the issue - the second assert throws an exception:

assertQueryEquals("a \\\"b c\\\" d", a, "a \"b c\" d");
assertQueryEquals("\"a \\\"b c\\\" d\"", a, "\"a \"b c\" d\"");
