Reduce usage of String.intern(), performance is terrible



Description:
I profiled a simple MatchAllDocsQuery() against ~1.5 million documents (8 fields of short text, Field.Store.YES,Field.Index.NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS), then retrieved all documents via searcher.doc(i, fs). String.intern() showed up as a top hotspot (see attached screenshot), so i implemented a small optimization to not intern() for every new Field(), instead forcing the intern in the FieldInfos class and adding a optional "internName" constructor to Field. This reduced execution time for searching and iterating through all documents by 35%. Results were similar for -server and -client.
