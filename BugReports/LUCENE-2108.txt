SpellChecker file descriptor leak - no way to close the IndexSearcher used by SpellChecker internally



Description:
I can't find any way to close the IndexSearcher (and IndexReader) that
is being used by SpellChecker internally.

I've worked around this issue by keeping a single SpellChecker open
for each index, but I'd really like to be able to close it and
reopen it on demand without leaking file descriptors.

Could we add a close() method to SpellChecker that will close the
IndexSearcher and null the reference to it? And perhaps add some code
that reopens the searcher if the reference to it is null? Or would
that break thread safety of SpellChecker?

The attached patch adds a close method but leaves it to the user to
call setSpellIndex to reopen the searcher if desired.
