reorganize xdocs and website



Description:
i would like to propose a change to the website and xdocs structure.

the current structure below seems like it could use a brush up.

---
Overview
Architecture Doc
.Overview
..JSR-170 Levels
.Deployment Models
..Application HOWTO
..Model 1 HOWTO
..Model 2 HOWTO
..Model 3 HOWTO
.Core Operations
..Start-up, Initialize
..QueryManager Implementation
First Steps
JCR API Documentation
Layout
Downloads
FAQ

i would propose the following, instead:
---
About 
Documentation
.First Steps
.JCR
.API Documentation
.Jackrabbit Architecture
..Start-up, Initialize
..QueryManager Implementation
.Deployment Models
..Application HOWTO
..Model 1 HOWTO
..Model 2 HOWTO
..Model 3 HOWTO
.Nodetype Modelling *new*
Layout

also i would like to introduce a new "homepage" with a little bit more attractive content like jackrabbit
news, maybe featured jackrabbit applications, schedules and events.

ideally i would like to re-organize the file structure according to the navigation, which may break
bookmarks and search indexes.

thoughts?
