ASCIIFoldingFilter: expose folding logic + small improvements to ISOLatin1AccentFilter



Description:
This patch adds a couple of non-ascii chars to ISOLatin1AccentFilter (namely: left & right single quotation marks, en dash, em dash) which we very frequently encounter in our projects. I know that this class is now deprecated; this improvement is for legacy code that hasn't migrated yet.

It also enables easy access to the ascii folding technique use in ASCIIFoldingFilter for potential re-use in non-Lucene-related code.
