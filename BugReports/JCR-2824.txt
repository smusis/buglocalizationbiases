Add RepositoryException to JackrabbitAccessControlList#getRestrictionNames and #getRestrictionType



Description:
Throughout the JCR and Jackrabbit API methods that include name processing are define to throw RepositoryException in case of 
an error related to name processing (due to lack of a more specific exception in the javax.jcr package space).

Unfortunately, I forgot those in JackrabbitAccessControlList and JackrabbitAccessControlEntry. While the latter has already been addressed for the 2.2 release,
I would like to fix the JackrabbitAccessControlList interface as well (and subsequently also fix the implementations that currently do not properly cope with 
names).
