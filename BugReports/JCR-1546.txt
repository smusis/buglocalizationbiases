H2PersistenceManager: no need to call shutdown; javadoc bugs



Description:
The H2PersistenceManager implementation calls "shutdown" to force closing the database when using file based databases. There is no need to do that when using the H2 database engine: the database is closed automatically when the last connection is closed.

Also, the javadocs of the H2PersistenceManager need to be fixed.
