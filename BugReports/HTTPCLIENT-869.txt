Incorrect/incomplete product name in META-INF/NOTICE file



Description:
The NOTICE file in the HttpClient jars is incorrect.

It states:

=====

HttpClient
Copyright 1999-2009 Apache Software Foundation
<snip/>
======

The leading blank line should be deleted, and "HttpClient" should be "Apache HttpComponents Client - HttpClient"  (or similar) as is the case for the source archive.

Similarly for HttpMime
