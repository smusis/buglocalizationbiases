Improper deprecation of Locked class



Description:
The Locked class in the jcr-commons package has been deprecated with 1.4 and moved to the spi-commons.
However as this is a common class which does not depend on the spi, it should rather stay in jcr-commons.
The dependencies to spi can simply be removed again.
