NodeTypeRegistry.validateNodeTypeDef causes NullPointerException



Description:
NodeTypeRegistry.registerNodeType(NodeTypeDef) checks the given node type definition for circular inheritance (amongst other things, of course). If the the node type definition does not contain a list of super types, the validateNodeTypeDef() (line 442) causes a NullPointerException being thrown in checkForCircularInheritance() because the "supertypes" variable is null and is not being checked.

Interestingly the other accesses to the same supertypes object in validNodeTypeDef() are all guarded against null and length==0. Might be an ommission.
