fix jackrabbit groupId



Description:
Actually the groupid used in maven project.xml is simply "jackrabbit".
However, the new naming policy adopted by maven requires the groupid to mirror the main package name, so it should be changed to "org.apache.jackrabbit".
Probably this could be a good moment to fix it, after the recent merge and modification of artifact ids.

A note about the new policy for groupid can be found in http://maven.apache.org/reference/repository-upload.html
