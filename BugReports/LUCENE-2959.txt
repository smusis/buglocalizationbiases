[GSoC] Implementing State of the Art Ranking for Lucene



Description:
Lucene employs the Vector Space Model (VSM) to rank documents, which compares
unfavorably to state of the art algorithms, such as BM25. Moreover, the architecture is
tailored specically to VSM, which makes the addition of new ranking functions a non-
trivial task.

This project aims to bring state of the art ranking methods to Lucene and to implement a
query architecture with pluggable ranking functions.
