TCK: Incorrect check of namespace mappings in System View XML export



Description:
org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.SysViewContentHandler. In endDocument(), two issues:

1. line 351: tries to go through a table of prefixes but uses a fixed index inside the loop;
2. The mapping for the 'xml' prefix should be skipped (it must be registered in the Session but must not be registered during export since this is a built-in XML mapping.
