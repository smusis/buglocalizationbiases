Query#mergeBooleanQueries argument should be of type BooleanQuery[] instead of Query[]



Description:
The method #mergeBooleanQueries accepts Query[] and casts elements to BooleanQuery without checking. This will guarantee a ClassCastException if it is not a boolean query. We should enforce this by changing the signature. This won't really break back compat. as it only works with instances of BooleanQuery.
