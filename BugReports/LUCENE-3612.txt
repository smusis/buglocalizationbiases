remove _X.fnx



Description:
Currently we store a global (not per-segment) field number->name mapping in _X.fnx

However, it doesn't actually save us any performance e.g on IndexWriter's init because
since LUCENE-2984 we are to loading the fieldinfos anyway to compute files() for IFD, etc, 
as thats where hasProx/hasVectors is.

Additionally in the past global files like shared doc stores have caused us problems,
(recently we just fixed a bug related to this file in LUCENE-3601).

Finally this is trouble for backwards compatibility as its difficult to handle a global
file with the codecs mechanism.
