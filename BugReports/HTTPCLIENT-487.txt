ParameterParser parse method for authentication headers does not appear to deal with empty value strings



Description:
Hi, I have found an issue with HTTPClient due to the way it parses parameter 
strings.

In particular, consider the following WWW-Authenticate header:

WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="", algorithm=MD5, qop="auth", 
domain="/content", nonce="0e11dcf146563c3a89e5327f0c5f5bad"
 
The realm is definitely specified, but is equal to the empty string.  It is not 
a null value.

However, the extractParams method of AuthChallengeParser which in turn calls 
ParameterParser will actually parse the value as Null  instead of an empty 
string.

This is due to parseQuotedToken getToken(true) call which essentially returns a 
null String result  as the condition i2>i1 fails :-

        String result = null;
        if (i2 > i1) {
            result = new String(chars, i1, i2 - i1);
        }
        return result;

As the processChallenge method of DigestScheme throws an exception when 
getParameter("realm") == null, HTTPClient is not able to process the digest 
request when an empty string realm value is present.
