Additional excerpt provider implementation



Description:
The current DefaultHTMLExcerpt implementation is very simple. It basically picks the first three fragments, regardless of how many matches it contains. There should be an alternative implementation that weights the fragments based on the number of matching terms and the whether phrases have matched.
