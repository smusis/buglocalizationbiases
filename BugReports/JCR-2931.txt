Compatibility issue if admin impersonates admin session



Description:
in revision 1076596 in made some improvements in ImpersonationImpl removing the shortcut for "AdminPrincipal" which from my point of view is problematic.

however, this introduced the following compatibility issue (detected by tom):
while - according to my tests - a user is allowed to impersonate itself (jcr isn't totally clear about this but states that Session.impersonate is used to "[...] impersonate" another [...]" this was possible for the admin-user due to the shortcut mentioned above.

in order not to break existing code relying on that special case, i would suggest to change the code accordingly.
