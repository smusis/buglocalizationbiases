IndexWriter retains references to Readers used in Fields (memory leak)



Description:
As described in [1] IndexWriter retains references to Reader used in Fields and that can lead to big memory leaks when using tika's ParsingReaders (as those can take 1MB per ParsingReader). 

[2] shows a screenshot of the reference chain to the Reader from the IndexWriter taken with Eclipse MAT (Memory Analysis Tool) . The chain is the following:

IndexWriter -> DocumentsWriter -> DocumentsWriterThreadState -> DocFieldProcessorPerThread  -> DocFieldProcessorPerField -> Fieldable -> Field (fieldsData)
