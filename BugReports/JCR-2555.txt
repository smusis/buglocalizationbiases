Improved reusability of the JCA package



Description:
The jackrabbit-jca package currently has hardcoded references to jackrabbit-core, which makes it difficult to reuse the packaging and related code with other JCR implementations. With the RepositoryFactory interface from JCR 2.0 we can avoid this hard dependency.
