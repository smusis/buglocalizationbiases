Jcr2Spi: Warning upon reloading property values



Description:
tobi reported the following log-warning being written upon reloading property values:

[WARN ] Property data has been discarded

It seems to me that this has been introduced with JCR-1963. Taking a closer look at it, i get the impression that
the 'discarded' flag should only be set if any values are notified accordingly. In addition it seems to me that the MergeResult should have a dispose() method (or something similar) in order to have the replaced (old) property values properly released...
