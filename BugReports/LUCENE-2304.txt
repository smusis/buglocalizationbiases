FuzzyLikeThisQuery should set MaxNonCompetitiveBoost for faster speed



Description:
FuzzyLikeThisQuery uses FuzzyTermsEnum directly, and maintains 
a priority queue for its purposes.

Just like TopTermsRewrite method, it should set the 
MaxNonCompetitiveBoost attribute, so that FuzzyTermsEnum can
run faster. Its already tracking the minScore, just not updating
the attribute.

This would be especially nice as it appears to have nice defaults
already (pq size of 50)
