spi2davex: session-scoped lock tokens not included in if-header



Description:
detected while running API lock tests.
org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.lock.DeepLockTest#testParentChildDeepLock failed though it used to work with spi2dav.

fix is simple: SessionInfoImpl.getAllLockTokens must be used to populate the if-header as it is done in spi2dav.
