PulsingTermState.clone leaks memory



Description:
I looked at the heap dump from the OOME this morning (thank you Uwe
for turning this on!), and I think it's a real memory leak.

Well, not really a leak; rather, the cloned PulsingTermState, which we
cache in the terms dict cache, is hanging onto large byte[]
unnecessarily.
