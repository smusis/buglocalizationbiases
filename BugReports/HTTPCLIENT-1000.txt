Configure Maximum Connection Lifetimes



Description:
Provide a means of configuring a maximum lifetime for HttpClient connections.  Currently, it would appear as long as a connection is used it may persist indefinitely.

This would be useful for situations where HttpClient needs to react to DNS changes, such as the following situation that may occur when using DNS load balancing:
 - HttpClient maintains connections to example.com which resolves to IP A
 - Machine at IP A fails, and example.com now resolves to backup machine at IP B
 - Since IP A is failing, connections are destroyed, and new connections are made to IP B
 - Machine at IP A recovers, but HttpClient maintains connections to IP B since the connections are still healthy

The desired behavior would be that connections to IP B will reach their connection lifetime, and new connections could be created back to IP A according to the updated DNS settings.
