Remove/deprecate Tokenizer's default ctor



Description:
I was working on a new Tokenizer... and I accidentally forgot to call super(input) (and super.reset(input) from my reset method)... which then meant my correctOffset() calls were silently a no-op; this is very trappy.

Fortunately the awesome BaseTokenStreamTestCase caught this (I hit failures because the offsets were not in fact being corrected).

One minimal thing we can do (but it sounds like from Robert there may be reasons why we can't) is add {{assert input != null}} in Tokenizer.correctOffset:

{noformat}

But best would be to remove the default ctor that leaves input null...
