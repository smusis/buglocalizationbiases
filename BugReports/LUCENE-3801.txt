Generify FST shortestPaths() to take a comparator



Description:
Not sure we should do this, it costs 5-10% performance for WFSTSuggester.
But maybe we can optimize something here, or maybe its just no big deal to us.

Because in general, this could be pretty powerful, e.g. if you needed to store 
some custom stuff in the suggester, you could use pairoutputs, or whatever.

And the possibility we might need shortestPaths for other cool things... at the
least I just wanted to have the patch up here.

I haven't tested this on pairoutputs... but i've tested it with e.g. FloatOutputs
and other things and it works fine.

I tried to minimize the generics violations, there is only 1 (cannot create generic array).
