Improve how ConcurrentMergeScheduler handles too-many-merges case



Description:
CMS now lets you set "maxMergeThreads" to control max # simultaneous
merges.

However, when CMS hits that max, it still allows further merges to
run, by running them in the foreground thread.  So if you set this max
to 1, and use 1 thread to add docs, you can get 2 merges running at
once (which I think is broken).

I think, instead, CMS should pause the foreground thread, waiting
until the number of merge threads drops below the limit.  Then, kick
off the backlog merge in a thread and return control back to primary
thread.
