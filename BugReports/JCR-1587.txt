When trying to reuse version label in transaction, exception is thrown



Description:
Following sequence causes failure:
1. first transaction:
  1.1 create versionable node
  1.2 create version 1 of this node
2. second transaction:
  2.1 create version 2 of this node
  2.2 assign a label to version 2
3. third transaction:
  3.1 restore a node to version 1
  3.2 remove version 2
  3.3 make version 3 of  same node
  3.4 assign same label (which was assigned to version 2) to version 3 -> fails

Same sequence which does not use transactions at all works fine.
Going to attach a test case.
