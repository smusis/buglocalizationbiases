Some improvements to _TestUtil and its usage



Description:
I've started this issue because I've noticed that _TestUtil.getRandomMultiplier() is called from many loops' condition check, sometimes hundreds and thousands of times. Each time it does Integer.parseInt after calling System.getProperty. This really can become a constant IMO, either in LuceneTestCase(J4) or _TestUtil, as it's not expected to change while tests are running ...

I then reviewed the class and spotted some more things that I think can be fixed/improved:
# getTestCodec() can become a constant as well
# arrayToString is marked deprecated. I've checked an no one calls them, so I'll delete them. This is a 4.0 code branch + a test-only class. No need to deprecate anything.
# getTempDir calls new Random(), instead of newRandom() in LuceneTestCaseJ4, which means that if something fails, we won't know the random seed used ...
#* In that regard, we might want to output all the classes that obtained a static seed in reportAdditionalFailures(), instead of just the class that ran the test.
# rmDir(String) can be removed IMO, and leave only rmDir(File)
# I suggest we include some recursion in rmDir(File) to handle the deletion of nested directories.
#* Also, it does not check whether the dir deletion itself succeeds (but it does so for the files). This can bite us on Windows, if some test did not close things properly.

I'll work out a patch.
