NTLM Authentication Fails



Description:
NTLM Authentication requires multiple request/responses for the authentication
to succeed.  Since HttpMethodBase is now using just the host, port and realm to
identify whether or not authentication has been attempted the second pass for
NTLM authentication is never performed.
