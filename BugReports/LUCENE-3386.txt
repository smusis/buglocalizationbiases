Integrate MockBM25Similarity and MockLMSimilarity into the framework



Description:
Steps:
1. Decide if {{MockLMSimilarity}} is needed at all (we have {{LMDirichletSimilarity}})
2. Move the classes to the similarities package
3. Move the similarities package to src/
4. Move all sims (inc. Similarity) to similarities
5. Make MockBM25Similarity a subclass of EasySimilarity?
