Inner classes of FilterAtomicReader (trunk) / FilterIndexReader (3.x) do not override all methods to be filtered



Description:
This issue adds missing checks in the FilterReader test to also check overridden methods in the enum implementations (inner classes) similar to the checks added by Shai Erea.
