Node.setProperty(String, ...) implementation not according to the specification



Description:
to illustrate the issue assume the following  property definition:

name: someText
type: String
non-mandatory
non-autocreate

the following call would throw a ConstraintViolationException
if the property doesn't exist yet:

node.setProperty("someText", 12345);

the rules used to find an applicable definition in this case are too strict.
