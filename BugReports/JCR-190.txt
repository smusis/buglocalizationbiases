Caching in QueryHandler does not scale well



Description:
Caching in class CachingIndexReader uses too much memory. It uses around 500 bytes per node and does not use any strategy to limit the cache.

This improvement covers two goals:
- lower per-node memory cost for caching
- implement a caching strategy using e.g LRU algorithm
