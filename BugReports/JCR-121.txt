JCRTest.java (First Steps example code) creates a StringValue with "new"



Description:
The JCRTest.java file described in the First Steps document (http://incubator.apache.org/jackrabbit/firststeps.html) on the jackrabbit incubator website contains a line that attempts to create a StringValue using new, rather than using the ValueFactory interface. This causes the code to fail to compile - perhaps an initiative test, but could be off-putting...

Simple fix is to swap the line:

 n.setProperty("testprop", new StringValue("Hello, World."));

to 

n.setProperty("testprop", session.getValueFactory().createValue("Hello, World."));
