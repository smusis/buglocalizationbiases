Abstract JCR base classes



Description:
Implement and use a set of abstract AbstractSession, AbstractItem, etc. classes that implement as much of the respective JCR interfaces using nothing else but calls to other JCR methods. These would be just like the AbstractMap, etc. classes in java.util.
