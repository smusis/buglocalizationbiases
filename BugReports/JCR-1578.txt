Jcr2Spi: UpdateTest#testUpdateRemovesExtraProperty and #testUpdateAddsMissingSubtree fail occasionally



Description:
issue reported by jukka:

Every now and then I see the following jcr2spi test failures on a
clean checkout:

    Tests in error:
      testUpdateRemovesExtraProperty(org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.UpdateTest)
      testUpdateAddsMissingSubtree(org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.UpdateTest)

The problem seems to be caused by the test cases automatically
choosing the "security" workspace for the update test. The reason why
the tests only fail occasionally is that currently the ordering of the
string array returned by getAccessibleWorkspaceNames() is not
deterministic.

I can work around the issue by making
RepositoryImpl.getWorkspaceNames() explicitly sort the returned array
of names, but a more proper fix would probably be to ensure that the
workspace selected by UpdateTest is useful for the test.
