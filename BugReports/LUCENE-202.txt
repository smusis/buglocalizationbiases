Document.fields() only returns stored fields



Description:
Document.fields() only returns stored fields, not those which are indexed but not 
stored. This is confusing, as there's a isStored() Method which doesn't make much 
sense then. 
 
Actually fields() returns all fields only just after Document.add(new Field(...)), even the 
ones which are not stored. Sounds confusing? :-) I'll attach a small program that 
demonstrates this. 
 
This should either be fixed so that all fields are always returned or it should be 
documented.
