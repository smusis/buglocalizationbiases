Node.getPath() will corrupt the session



Description:
When calling Node.getPath() anytime, no mather if its before or after save, and when deleting nodes, the internal reference points to the wrong nodes. 
The attached test will always fail with a javax.jcr.RepositoryException: /: cannot remove root node. 
We have seen other configurations where a node suddenly behaves as the another node that has references and throw a reference exception, and yet other configurations where the node we though we deleted still exists, and another node has now disappeared.

I do not know what causes the bug,a good bet is perhaps the CachingHierarchyManager?. It was not present in Jackrabbit 1.0.1, but was introduced in 1.1.

Have also tested the latest release: 1.2.2, and the bug is still present there.
