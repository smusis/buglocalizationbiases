The native FS lock used in test-framework's o.a.l.util.LuceneJUnitResultFormatter prohibits testing on a multi-user system



Description:
{{LuceneJUnitResultFormatter}} uses a lock to buffer test suites' output, so that when run in parallel, they don't interrupt each other when they are displayed on the console.

The current implementation uses a fixed directory ({{lucene_junit_lock/}} in {{java.io.tmpdir}} (by default {{/tmp/}} on Unix/Linux systems) as the location of this lock.  This functionality was introduced on SOLR-1835.

As Shawn Heisey reported on SOLR-2739, some tests fail when run as root, but succeed when run as a non-root user.
