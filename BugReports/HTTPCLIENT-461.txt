HttpClient does not correctly handle escaped characters in HTTP header elements



Description:
An excerpt from Microsoft's "How Digest Authentication Works":

* RFC 2617-compliant Digest Authentication challenges and responses must also
comply with RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1 quoted string
requirements. This requirement particularly affects the use of backslash (\) and
embedded double quotes. Both must be preceded (escaped) with a backslash.

* For example, domain\username according to RFC 2616 is read as domainusername.
This reading is important because if an application sends information in this
format rather than as domain\\username, authentication fails.

* However, because this is a known issue with domain\username , if
authenticating with backslash encoding fails, Digest SSP attempts to
authenticate the response and assumes that the backslash is part of the string.
This behavior can be turned off by setting the ServerCompat registry key.

Review and fix the ParameterParser class and classes implemeting CookieSpec or
AuthScheme interfaces
