ClassCastException in GroupImpl.isCyclicMembership



Description:
Given three groups and one user with the following membership relation

group1 > group2 > group3
group2 > user

where x > y means x contains y.

group3.addMember(group1) throws a ClassCastException.

The reason is that the search type (i.e. UserManager.SEARCH_TYPE_GROUP) is not honored correctly when constructing the transitive membership relation.
