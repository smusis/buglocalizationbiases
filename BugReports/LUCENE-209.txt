Lucene requires ant 1.6?



Description:
The latest version in CVS as of April 3rd only builds with ant 1.6.   If this is intentional, BUILD.txt should 
be updated.

Here's the error I get with ant 1.5:

BUILD FAILED
file:/Users/skybrian/remote-cvs/jakarta-lucene/build.xml:11: Unexpected element "tstamp"
