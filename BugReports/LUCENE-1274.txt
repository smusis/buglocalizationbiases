Expose explicit 2-phase commit in IndexWriter



Description:
Currently when IndexWriter commits, it does so with a two-phase
commit, internally: first it prepares all the new index files, syncs
them; then it writes a new segments_N file and syncs that, and only if
that is successful does it remove any now un-referenced index files.

However, these two phases are done privately, internal to the commit()
method.

But when Lucene is involved in a transaction with external resources
(eg a database), it's very useful to explicitly break out the prepare
phase from the commit phase.
