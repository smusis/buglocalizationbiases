Credentials ignored if realm specified in preemptive authentication



Description:
When you specifiy credentials for a specific realm using preemptive 
authentication, the credentials are ignored during the first try (error 401 
back).

...
HttpClient client = new HttpClient(manager);
client.getState().setCredentials("myRealm","myHost",
			new UsernamePasswordCredentials(
				"user","password"));
client.getState().setAuthenticationPreemptive(true); 
...

"myRealm" will be ignored in HttpState's matchCredentials() private method 
because during preemptive authentication, it is called with a null realm:

 private static Credentials matchCredentials(HashMap map, String realm, String 
host) {
        HttpAuthRealm entry = new HttpAuthRealm(host, realm);
	// no possible match here, map only contains the version with the realm
        Credentials creds = (Credentials) map.get(entry);
        if (creds == null && host != null && realm != null) {
            entry = new HttpAuthRealm(host, null);
            creds = (Credentials) map.get(entry);
            if (creds == null) {
                entry = new HttpAuthRealm(null, realm);
                creds = (Credentials) map.get(entry);
            }
        }
        if (creds == null) {
            creds = (Credentials) map.get(DEFAULT_AUTH_REALM);
        }
        return creds;
    } 

This is quite logical since the realm comes from the server and you don't 
contact the server first during preemptive authentication.

But, it should not be possible to set a realm when using preemptive mode, or at 
least it should not be silently ignored.

The current workaround is to set the realm to null in setCredential(), no 
elegant but works.
