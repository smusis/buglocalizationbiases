CachingHieraarchyManager may serve moved items



Description:
There is a problem with weak referenced item states and event notification in the
LocalItemStateManager.

consider the following:
- Session A traverses some nodes and fills-up the cache of the ChachingHierarchyManager
- This also fills the weak-ref cache in Session A LocalItemStateManager.
- Session B does some operations
- At some point, GC decides to remove the weakly refferenced ItemStates in Session As
  LocalItemStateManager
- Session B moves a node and saves the changes.
- The SharedItemStateManager notifies all listeners that a node was modified
- The LocalItemStateManager of Session A receives the event, but does not bubble it,
  because it does not have the item anymore in its cache
- The CachingHierarchyManager of Session A never receives the modification event and still
  servers the items at the old location.

Solution A:
reconnect missing states in the LocalItemStateManager when an event is received. this has
the drawback that a lot of state would be generated that are not needed.

Solution B:
add a new event 'nodeModified' that is only sent by the LocalItemStateManager if a
'stateModified' was received for which it does not have the item aymore. this has the
drawback that alot more events are generated.

Will implement solution B
