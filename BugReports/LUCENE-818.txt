IndexWriter should detect when it's used after being closed

If you call addDocument on IndexWriter after it's closed you'll hit a
hard-to-explain NullPointerException (because the RAMDirectory was
closed).  Before 2.1, apparently you won't hit any exception and the
IndexWrite will keep running but will have released it's write lock (I
think).

I plan to fix IndexWriter methods to throw an IllegalStateException if
it has been closed.
