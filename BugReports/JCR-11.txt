XMLPersistenceManager incorrectly handles properties



Description:
JCR Property instances are written by the XMLPersistenceManager as java.util.Properties files and loaded through the loadPropertyState() method as Properties files. Unfortunately the reload() method tries to re-load the Property states from XML files, which is not possible.
