jcr-server should honor a webdav request's Content-Type and Content-Language headers



Description:
when processing a PUT or a POST, the DavResource should have access to the Content-Type and Content-Language headers presented in the webdav request, if any.

when the client explicitly communicates these headers, their values should take priority over server calculations (such as that done in SetContentTypeCommand), or at least be input into server calculations

furthermore, the dav getcontentlanguage is not at all supported by at least the simple webdav server.
