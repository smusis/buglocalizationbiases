AbstractConnPool constructor calls thread.Start()



Description:
AbstractConnPool constructor calls thread.Start()

Findbugs says:

Constructor invokes Thread.start()

The constructor starts a thread. This is likely to be wrong if the class is ever extended/subclassed, since the thread will be started before the subclass constructor is started.

The class is not final (and the constructor is protected) which suggests that the class is intended to be extended...
