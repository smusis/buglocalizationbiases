Make observation polling time configurable



Description:
Currently the polling time is hard coded to 3 seconds in org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.WorkspaceImpl. I suggest to make it configurable similar to CacheBehaviour. That is, add a respective setting to org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.config.RepositoryConfig
