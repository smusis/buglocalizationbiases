add UnicodeUtil.nextValidUTF16String 



Description:
In flex branch, TermRef must not contain unpaired surrogates, etc.
But in trunk/previous releases, people could (and do) seek to these.
Also some lucene multitermqueries will generate these invalid seek locations, even now (which we should separately fix)
I think the common case is already handled with a hack in SegmentReader.LegacyTermEnum, but we should clean up this hack and handle all cases.

I would also like to use this nextValidUTF16String in LUCENE-1606, and there might be other places it could be used for better bw compat.
