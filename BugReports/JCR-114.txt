Suggestion regarding NodeImpl and PropertyImpl in jackrabbit.core



Description:
Both NodeImpl and PropertyImpl contain in their respective setProperty/setValue (respectively) initial validation checks, that is indentical across the various
variants of each and could possibly in either case be place in a separate method.

in NodeImpl.setProperty (also: addMixin, removeMixin, orderBefore):

- sanityCheck
- is-parent-checked-out
- is-not-protected (missing for setProperty ???)
- is-parent-not-locked

in PropertyImpl.setValue:

- sanityCheck
- is-parent-checked-out
- is-not-protected 
- is-value-compatible-with-multivalue-definition (NOTE: check opposite for setting single
  or multiple values)
- is-parent-not-locked


Second, i'm never sure, in which case ChildNode, ChildProperty is prefered 
over Node/Property (as present in the jcr api)...
