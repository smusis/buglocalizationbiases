IndexWriter should let you optionally enable reader pooling



Description:
For apps using a large index and frequently need to commit and resolve deletes, the cost of opening the SegmentReaders on demand for every commit can be prohibitive.

We an already pool readers (NRT does so), but, we only turn it on if NRT readers are in use.

We should allow separate control.

We should do this after LUCENE-2294.
