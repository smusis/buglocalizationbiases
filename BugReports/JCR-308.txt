Nodes having OPV=Ignore are removed on restore



Description:
JCR1.0 Specification mentions:

8.2.11.5 IGNORE
  Child Node
    On checkin of N, no state information about C will be stored in VN.
    On restore of VN, the child node C of the current N will remain and not be removed.
  Property
    On checkin of N, no state information about P will be stored in VN.
    On restore of VN, the property P of the current N will remain and not be removed.

but the current implementation removed the ignore child.
