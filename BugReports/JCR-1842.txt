SPI: RepositoryService.obtain should allow to pass null workspaceName indicating the default workspace



Description:
improvement suggested by tobi

the contract of

public SessionInfo obtain(Credentials credentials, String workspaceName)
public SessionInfo obtain(Credentials credentials, String workspaceName)

should be changed to allow for null workspaceName.

* @param workspaceName the name of the workspace the <code>SessionInfo</code>
* should be built for. <code>null</code> indicates that the info should be created for the
* default workspace.

consequently we could either deprecate 

RepositoryConfig.getDefaultWorkspaceName()

or allow it to return null as well or remove it altogether.
