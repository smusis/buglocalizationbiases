Cookie with domain .mydomain.com not sent to host mydomain.com



Description:
A cookie with for example 
  .mydomain.com 
as domain property is not sent to the host
  mydomain.com
(without www. or anything else before "mydomain.com")

This concern all CookieSpec as the relevant code is located in CookieSpecBase:

    public boolean domainMatch(final String host, final String domain) {
        return host.endsWith(domain);
    }

It should be changed for instance to something like:

    public boolean domainMatch(final String host, final String domain) {
        // take care of host "myDomain.com" and domain ".myDomain.com"
        return host.endsWith(domain)
	|| _host.equals(_domain.substring(1));
    }
