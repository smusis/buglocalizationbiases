Indexing performance tests with realtime branch



Description:
We should run indexing performance tests with the DWPT changes and compare to trunk.

We need to test both single-threaded and multi-threaded performance.

NOTE:  flush by RAM isn't implemented just yet, so either we wait with the tests or flush by doc count.
