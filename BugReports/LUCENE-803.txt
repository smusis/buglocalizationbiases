add svn ignores for eclipse artifacts



Description:
Be nice to ignore the files eclipse puts into the project root as we do the .idea file for intellij.

The two files are

.project
.classpath

I'm gonna lie and say there's a patch available for this because an svn diff patch with propery changes can't be applied with patch anyway.
