TCK: RestoreTest.testRestoreLabel



Description:
According to tobi the jackrabbit implementation of 'Node.restoreByLabel' is an interpretation of the
specification regarding the restore behaviour of versionable child nodes. while that interpetration might
be legal unless the specification is violated, i would argue that the TCK should not test the interpretation.

therefore i suggest to modify

org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.version.RestoreTest.testRestoreLabel

by skipping line 334 - 345 in order to limit the test case to the behaviour that is defined by the specification.

regards
angela

ps: the mentioned test is also executed within the scope of WorkspaceRestoreTest because the latter  extends RestoreTest.... that's misleading.
