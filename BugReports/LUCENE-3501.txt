random sampler is not random (and so facet SamplingWrapperTest occasionally fails)



Description:
RandomSample is not random at all:
It does not even import java.util.Random, and its behavior is deterministic.

in addition, the test testCountUsingSamping() never retries as it was supposed to (for taking care of the hoped-for randomness).
