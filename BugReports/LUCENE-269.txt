[PATCH] demo HTML parser corrupts foreign characters



Description:
We are using HTML parser for parsing English and other NL documents in 
Eclipse.  Post Lucene 1.2 there has been a regression in the parser.  
Characters coming from Reader (obtained from getReader() ) are corrupted.  
Only the characters that can be encoded using the default machine encoding go 
through correctly.  For example, parsing Chinese document on an English 
machine results with all characters, except the few English words, corrupted.
