Observation logs error when a node is moved in place



Description:
An error message is written to the log when the following sequence of operations is executed:

- create node 'parent'
- create node 'child' as a child of 'parent'
- save
- create node 'tmp'
- move 'child' under 'tmp'
- remove 'parent'
- move 'tmp' to former path of 'parent'

The log will say: EventStateCollection: Unable to calculate old path of moved node

This is because the zombie path of 'child' is equal to the new path after the move. The EventStateCollection detects a new parentId assigned to 'child' and expects a new path that is different from the zombie path. The above case however shows that there is a use case where the paths are equal and events should be generated.
