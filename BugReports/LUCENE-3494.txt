Remove per-document multiply in FilteredQuery



Description:
Spinoff of LUCENE-1536.

In LUCENE-1536, Uwe suggested using FilteredQuery under-the-hood to implement filtered search.

But this query is inefficient, it does a per-document multiplication (wrapped.score() * boost()).

Instead, it should just pass the boost down in its weight, like BooleanQuery does to avoid this per-document multiply.
