Setting different MAX_HOST_CONNECTION values per host using a single MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager



Description:
Right now, it's not possible to use the
MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.setMaxConnectionsPerHost(int) method in a per
HostConfiguration basis. The value applies to every HostConfiguration the
current connection manager is managing.

I would be quite useful to allow the connection manager to set different values
depending on the HostConfiguration.
