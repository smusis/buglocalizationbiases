CachingHttpClient returns a 411 respones when executing a POST (HttpPost) request 



Description:
The CachingHttpClient validates requests prior executing them, by calling RequestProtocolCompliance.requestIsFatallyNonCompliant(..).

When executing an HttpPost, this method considers the request is invalid because it does not contain (yet) a content-length header. Indeed, I observed that this header is generated at the time the DefaultHttpClient fires the request.

NB: i'm using the Cache 4.1-alpha2 plugged over the HttpClient 4.0.1-final. I can't use the latest version for both because I need to rely on a stable version if there's any. I would be curious to know if we get the same behaviour in 4.1...

Anyway, I would see two fixes for that issue:
- make HttpPost set the content-length at the time the entity is set,
- or remove the validation step on the CachingHttpClient side.
