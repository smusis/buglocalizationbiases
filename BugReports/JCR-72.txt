Session.impersonate non-functional



Description:
Currently SessionImpl.impersonate simply calls Repository.login with the given credentials and the workspace name of the session. If the credentials are incomplete in that the password is missing, the method throws a "LoginException: Failed to authenticate userID", which is actually a misleading text, as the reason is not failure to authenticate userID but at best that the session has not enough access rights to impersonate as userID.

For my application, it is crucial, that Session.impersonate is implemented in the sense that this method allows creation of a session with password-less credentials. I accept this method to fail, but it should fail with a correct message.
