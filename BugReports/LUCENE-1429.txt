close() throws incorrect IllegalStateEx after IndexWriter hit an OOME when autoCommit is true



Description:
Spinoff from http://www.nabble.com/IllegalStateEx-thrown-when-calling-close-to20201825.html

When IndexWriter hits an OOME, it records this and then if close() is
called it calls rollback() instead.  This is a defensive measure, in
case the OOME corrupted the internal buffered state (added/deleted
docs).

But there's a bug: if you opened IndexWriter with autoCommit true,
close() then incorrectly throws an IllegalStatException.

This fix is simple: allow rollback to be called even if autoCommit is
true, internally during close.  (External calls to rollback with
autoCommmit true is still not allowed).
