'OR' in XPath query badly interpreted



Description:
executing query: //*[@a=1 and @b=2 or @c=3] leads to creating wrong query tree. The builded tree looks like for query: //*[@a=1 and @b=2 and @c=3](see attachement). using brackets resolves the problem, but without brackets output query is different from input query. When AND and OR are switched(so the OR is in first palce - //*[@a=1 or @b=2 and @c=3]) everything is ok.
