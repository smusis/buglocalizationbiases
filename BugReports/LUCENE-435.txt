[PATCH] BufferedIndexOutput - optimized writeBytes() method



Description:
I have created a patch that optimize writeBytes metod:

  public void writeBytes(byte[] b, int length) throws IOException {
    if (bufferPosition > 0) // flush buffer
      flush();
 
    if (length < BUFFER_SIZE) {
      flushBuffer(b, length);
      bufferStart += length;
    } else {
      int pos = 0;
      int size;
      while (pos < length) {
        if (length - pos < BUFFER_SIZE) {
          size = length - pos;
        } else {
          size = BUFFER_SIZE;
        }
        System.arraycopy(b, pos, buffer, 0, size);
        pos += size;
        flushBuffer(buffer, size);
        bufferStart += size;
      }
    }
  }

Its a much more faster now. I know that for indexing this not help much, but for copying files in the IndexStore this is so big improvement. Its about 400% faster that old implementation.

The patch was tested with 300MB data, "ant test" sucessfuly finished with no errors.
