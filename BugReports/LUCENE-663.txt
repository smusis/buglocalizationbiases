New feature rich higlighter for Lucene.



Description:
Well, I refactored (took) some code from two previous highlighters.
This highlighter:
+ use TermPositionVector where available
+ use Analyzer if no TermPositionVector found or is forced to use it.
+ support for all lucene queries (Term, Phrase with slops, Prefix, Wildcard, Range) except Fuzzy Query (can be implemented easly)

- has no support for scoring (yet)
- use same prefix,postfix for accepted terms (yet)

? It's written in Java5

In next release I'd like to add support for Fuzzy, "coloring" f.e. diffrent color for terms btw. phrase terms (slops), scoring of fragments

It's apache licensed - I hope so :-) I put licene statement in every file
