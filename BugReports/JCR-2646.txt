AccessControlManager#getEffectivePolicies(String) may expose AC content without proper permissions



Description:
The implementation of AccessControlManager#getEffectivePolicies(String) in the DefaultAccessManager only checks if the session is allowed
to read AC content at the specified path. However the result may also include policies effective at absPath that should not be visible to the editing
session (read_AC permissions denied e.g. at an ancestor node) and could not be read by the editing session be means of #getPolicies().
