VersionManagerImplRestore internalRestoreFrozen method has identity versus equals bug



Description:
In method protected void internalRestoreFrozen(NodeStateEx state,
                                         InternalFrozenNode freeze,
                                         VersionSelector vsel,
                                         Set<InternalVersion> restored,
                                         boolean removeExisting,
                                         boolean copy)
in the VersionManagerImplRestore class line 557 the code performs an == instead of calling the NodeId.equals() method.  We ran into problems with the code that executes below this (trying to restore a folder node throws an ItemExistsException since same sibling not allowed on folder nodes)
