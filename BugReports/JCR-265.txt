Bug with textfilters and classloaders



Description:
I'm having problems with text filter service. I built the contrib/textfilters package and I included the resulting jackrabbit-textfilters-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in my application classpath. The problem is that TextFilterService class is unable to find any filters, even though that a services/org...TextFilterService file is wihin the META-INF jar's directory.

I think that this must to be with Eclipse RCP classloader mechanism, but the fact is that it does not work. I find a little bit strange this way to load services, and as you can see, it seems problematic in some scenarios.

Hi Martin,

we had a similar problem with the query languages, but I solved that one
by telling the registry to use a specific classloader. this seemed to work.
I'm not sure this will also work for the text filters, because the jar
file might be in another classloader.

could you please post a jira bug? I'll then change the discovery
mechanism to use good old xml config ;)
