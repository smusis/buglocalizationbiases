Adding a factory to QueryParser to instantiate query instances



Description:
With the new efforts with Payload and scoring functions, it would be nice to plugin custom query implementations while using the same QueryParser.
Included is a patch with some refactoring the QueryParser to take a factory that produces query instances.
