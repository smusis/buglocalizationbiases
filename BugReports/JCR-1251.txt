DescendantSelfAxisQuery creates too many object instances



Description:
In DescendantSelfAxisQuery.DescendantSelfAxisScorer.isValid() there is an ArrayList and an Integer instance created on every call. Since this method gets called really often during queries the object creation/gc affects performance.
