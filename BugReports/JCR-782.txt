TCK: LockTest.testGetLock compares Nodes with equals



Description:
i think comparison by 'isSame' would be better.

-> line 545

-        assertTrue("lock holding node must be parent", lock.getNode().equals(n1));
+        assertTrue("lock holding node must be parent", lock.getNode().isSame(n1));
