Redefine HttpClient vs HttpMultiClient interface for 2.0



Description:
In particular the HttpClient/HttpMultiClient issue must be resolved. 
HttpultiClient functionality should be prefered, but HttpClient is the most
suitable name.  Consider impact to other projects.  Is java1.1 compatability
really an issue anymore?
