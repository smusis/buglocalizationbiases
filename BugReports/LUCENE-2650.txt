improve windows defaults in FSDirectory



Description:
Currently windows defaults to SimpleFSDirectory, but this is a problem due to the synchronization.

I have been benchmarking queries *sequentially* and was pretty surprised at how much faster
MMapDirectory is, for example for cases that do many seeks.

I think we should change the defaults for windows as such:

if (WINDOWS and UNMAP_SUPPORTED and 64-bit)
  use MMapDirectory
else
  use SimpleFSDirectory 

I think we should just consider doing this for 4.0 only and see how it goes.
