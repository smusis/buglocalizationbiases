ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in NodeTypeDefDiff



Description:
It appears that the code for building diffs in child node definitions loops incorrectly, opening the possibility for an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception. The offending portion is in the "buildChildNodeDefDiffs" method:

<<
NodeDef[] cnda2 = newDef.getChildNodeDefs();
HashMap defs2 = new HashMap();
for (int i = 0; i < cnda1.length; i++) {
    defs2.put(cnda2[i].getId(), cnda2[i]);
}
>>

It seems like simply changing the length check to be cnda2 (as it is in "buildPropDefsDiff") would suffice.
