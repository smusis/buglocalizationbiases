Numeric range searching with large value sets



Description:
I have a set of enhancements that build on the numeric sorting cache introduced
by Tim Jones and that provide integer and floating point range searches over
numeric ranges that are far too large to be implemented via the current term
range rewrite mechanism.  I'm new to Apache and trying to find out how to attach
the source files for the changes for your consideration.
