add @Deprecated annotations



Description:
as discussed on LUCENE-2084, I think we should be consistent about use of @Deprecated annotations if we are to use it.

This patch adds the missing annotations... unfortunately i cannot commit this for some time, because my internet connection does not support heavy committing (it is difficult to even upload a large patch).

So if someone wants to take it, have fun, otherwise in a week or so I will commit it if nobody objects.
