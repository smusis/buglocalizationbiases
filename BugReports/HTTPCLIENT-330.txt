[PATCH] Wirelog corrections



Description:
This patch 

* fixes the problem reported by Geir H. Pettersen <geir at cellus.no>. See
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=108072355300004&r=1&w=2 for details

* increases the priority of HTTP request/status line & HTTP headers output from
DEBUG to INFO. Quite often request/response content generate excessive amount of
output in the wirelog and produce no valuable debug information of what so ever.
By setting wirelog verbosity to INFO one can turn off the logging of 
request/response content.

I believe the patch should be applied to both CVS HEAD and 2.0 branch. Please
let me know if you agree
