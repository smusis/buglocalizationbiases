[PATCH] Problem with Sort logic on tokenized fields



Description:
When you set s SortField to a Text field which gets tokenized
FieldCacheImpl uses the term to do the sort, but then sorting is off 
especially with more then one word in the field. I think it is much 
more logical to sort by field's string value if the sort field is Tokenized and
stored. This way you'll get the CORRECT sort order
