Locking bug



Description:
In org.apache.lucene.store.Lock, line 57 (lucene_1_4_final branch):

if (++sleepCount == maxSleepCount)

is incorrect, the sleepCount is incremented before the compare causing it
throwing the exception with out waiting for at least 1 interation.

Should be changed instead to:
if (sleepCount++ == maxSleepCount)

As this is a self-contained simple fix, I am not submitting a patch.

Thanks
