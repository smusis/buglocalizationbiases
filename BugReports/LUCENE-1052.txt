Add an "termInfosIndexDivisor" to IndexReader



Description:
The termIndexInterval, set during indexing time, let's you tradeoff
how much RAM is used by a reader to load the indexed terms vs cost of
seeking to the specific term you want to load.

But the downside is you must set it at indexing time.

This issue adds an indexDivisor to TermInfosReader so that on opening
a reader you could further sub-sample the the termIndexInterval to use
less RAM.  EG a setting of 2 means every 2 * termIndexInterval is
loaded into RAM.

This is particularly useful if your index has a great many terms (eg
you accidentally indexed binary terms).
