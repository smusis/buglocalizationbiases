Create resource sensitive cache for item states



Description:
there is currently a lru-caching strategy for the itemstates in the shared ism, with a hardcoded limit of 1000 entries. the problem is that the size of the states is not respected in the caching strategy; this poses a problem, if the
states are large (i.e. large values in property states, or large number of childnode entries).
