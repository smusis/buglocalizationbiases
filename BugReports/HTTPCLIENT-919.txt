NTLM implementation lacks support for NTLMv1, NTLMv2, and NTLM2 Session forms of NTLM



Description:
The current HttpClient implementation lacks support for all enhancements to NTLM after Windows 95.  That includes NTLMv1, NTLMv2, and NTLM2 Session Response varieties of the protocol.

This seriously impacts the usability of HttpClient in enterprise situations, which has required the Lucene Connector Framework team to extend HttpClient to address the issue.

I've attached a patch which contains the implementation used by LCF.
