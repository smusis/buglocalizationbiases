Unable to get the status line from a http method object



Description:
The status line (typically the first line returned from a http connection read)
is hidden inside httpclient with no way for client code to retrieve it intact.
readStatusLine() in HttpMethodBase is where the status line is
read, but it is never stored and is not available outside the method.

We could store the status line as a string and add a getStatusLine
method to the HttpMethod interface and HttpMethodBase class.  Alternatively, we
could create a header for it with the name StatusLine (or perhaps just null) so
that it could be retrieved with getHeader("StatusLine").  This would preserve
the interface but would be a bit of a kludge.
