FileSwitchDirectory should uniqueify the String file names returned by listAll



Description:
Right now we blindly concatenate what's returned from primary & secondary.

But a legit use of FSD is pointing to the same underlying FSDir but w/ different impls for opening the inputs/outputs.

I have simple patch that just uniqueifies using Set<String>.
