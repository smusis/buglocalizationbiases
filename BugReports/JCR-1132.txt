XSLT pretty-printer for JCR document view export files



Description:
The attached XSLT pretty-prints Jackrabbit XML document view export files.

I'm uploading it here so others can use it or improve it.

For now I'm using it standalone to document content structures, later I might create a servlet that applies it live to repository content.
