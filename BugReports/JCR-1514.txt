SPI: Javadoc Issue with QNodeTypeDefinition#getPropertyDefs and #getChildNodeDefs



Description:
Javadoc of the mentioned methods currently states:

@return an array containing the property definitions or
     *         <code>null</code> if not set.

while the default implementation returns an empty array, which i find much nicer.

if nobody objects, i would fix the javadoc accordingly.
