AbstractLoginModule#logout() : credentials will not be clared as Subject.getPublicCredentials(Class) isn't backed by the subject internal set



Description:
AbstractLoginModule#logout()  clears the credentials list retrieved by calling Subject.getPublicCredentials(Class).
this doesn't have the desired effect as the returned set isn't backed by the subjects internal credentials set. (see API documentation of javax.security.auth.Subject)
