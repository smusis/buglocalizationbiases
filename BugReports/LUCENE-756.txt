Maintain norms in a single file .nrm



Description:
Non-compound indexes are ~10% faster at indexing, and perform 50% IO activity comparing to compound indexes. But their file descriptors foot print is much higher. 

By maintaining all field norms in a single .nrm file, we can bound the number of files used by non compound indexes, and possibly allow more applications to use this format.
