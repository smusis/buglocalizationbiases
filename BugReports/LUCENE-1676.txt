New Token filter for adding payloads "in-stream"



Description:
This TokenFilter is able to split a token based on a delimiter and use one part as the token and the other part as a payload.  This allows someone to include payloads inline with tokens (presumably setup by a pipeline ahead of time).  An example is apropos.  Given a | delimiter, we could have a stream that looks like:
{quote}The quick|JJ red|JJ fox|NN jumped|VB over the lazy|JJ brown|JJ dogs|NN{quote}

In this case, this would produce tokens and payloads (assuming whitespace tokenization):
Token: the
Payload: null

Token: quick
Payload: JJ

Token: red
Pay: JJ.

and so on.

This patch will also support pluggable encoders for the payloads, so it can convert from the character array to byte arrays as appropriate.
