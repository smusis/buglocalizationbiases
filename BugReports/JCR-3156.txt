Group#getMembers may list inherited members multiple times



Description:
i just happen to detect the following regression that seems to be introduces quite a while ago:

Group#getMembers is defined to return all group members including those inherited by another group being member of that group.

Example:
User t
Group a : t is declared member
Group b : t is declared member
Group c : a, b are declared members

The expected result of Group.getMembers was: a, b and t.

What is currently happening is that t is included twice in the returned iterator.
Quickly testing on jackrabbit 2.0 revealed that this used to work before...

I didn't carefully check when that bug has been introduced but the the refactoring of the membership
collections seems to be a possible culprit.
