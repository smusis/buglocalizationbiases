Rename Field.Index.UN_TOKENIZED/TOKENIZED/NO_NORMS



Description:
There is confusion about these current Field options and I think we
should rename them, deprecating the old names in 2.4/2.9 and removing
them in 3.0.  How about this:

{code}
TOKENIZED --> ANALYZED
UN_TOKENIZED --> NOT_ANALYZED
NO_NORMS --> NOT_ANALYZED_NO_NORMS
{code}

Should we also add ANALYZED_NO_NORMS?
