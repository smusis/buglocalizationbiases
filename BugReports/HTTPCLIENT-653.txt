connection wrapper prevents GC of TSCCM



Description:
Even if a connection is released back to the ThreadSafeClientConnManager, a hard reference to the connection wrapper will prevent GC of the TSCCM.
Make sure the connection wrapper is properly detached on release. Then update TestTSCCMWithServer.testConnectionManagerGC() accordingly.
