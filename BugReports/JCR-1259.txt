Utility code for filtering and packaging trees



Description:
The attached zip contains new utility code for filtering and packaging trees in the repository.

A tree can be traversed by the provided tree walker. During the traversal configurable filters can be applied. The filters have influence on the traversal, like skipping nodes or properties.
Included filters test the node name, node type etc. Custom filters are possible as well.
A tree walker notifies a tree walker listener (interface) whenever it traverses an item.

The second utility code is able to package a whole tree (through a description) and export this in some way - the exporter is an interface and could e.g. be an exporter serializing the tree into a zip archiv etc.
