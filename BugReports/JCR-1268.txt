Move JCRWebdavServerServlet to jcr-server and make it abstract



Description:
In line with isse JCR-417, I suggest to partially move the JCRWebdavServerServlet from the jcr-webapp project to the jcr-server project. By partially I mean, that the new (moved) servlet will be abstract and the getRepository() method will be abstract. The jcr-webapp project will still contain a JCRWebdavServerServlet (for backwards compatibility maintaing the same name) which just extends the new servlet and implements the getRepository() method using the RepositoryAccess servlet.

This allows for the reuse of the jcr-server project including the abstract JCRWebdavServerServlet in other environments.
