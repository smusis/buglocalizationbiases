Deprecate and replace SimpleHttpConnection with the SimpleHttpServer based testing framework



Description:
Thanks to Christian Kohlschuetter and Odi we now have a very flexible testing
framework, which enables us to emulate pretty much all the aspects of a HTTP
server functionality including non-compliant behavior and various vendor
specific implementation quirks. 

Many, many thanks go to Christian Kohlschuetter for having contributed the
original code. 

I propose SimpleHttpConnection be deprecated and eventually be phased out. I
took the first steps toward this goal by migrating Basic authentication test
cases. I urge all committers and contributors to use SimpleHttpServer for all
the new cases from now on. Ideally in the future we should even be able to get
rid of Tomcat as a dependency for testing.

I also took liberty of tweaking the SimpleHttpServer API a little. I factored
SimpleRequest and SimpleResponse classes out and provided a new interface called
HttpService, which can be used instead of HttpRequestHandler to implement test
cases in a way very similar to writing servlets. 

I'll commit the patch shortly as it does not really touch any _productive_ code.
