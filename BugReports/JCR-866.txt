ResidualProperties Converter uses wrong AtomicType Converter on update



Description:
When writing back data, the ResidualPropertiesCollectionConverterImpl.internalSetProperties method looks at the type of the Java object
to find the atomic type converter instead of getting the converter according to the collection descriptor.

This may lead to NullPointerExceptions in case the concrete type is an extension (or implementation) of the declared type.

I am currently working on a patch to attache to this bug.
