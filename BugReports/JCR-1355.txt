XML import should not access external entities



Description:
With current Jackrabbit the following XML document can not be imported:

    <!DOCTYPE foo SYSTEM "http://invalid.address/"><foo/>

Even if the DTD address (or some other external resource referenced in the XML document) is correct, I don't think importXML() should even try resolving those references.
