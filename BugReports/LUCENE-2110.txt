Refactoring of FilteredTermsEnum and MultiTermQuery



Description:
FilteredTermsEnum is confusing as it is initially positioned to the first term. It should instead work like an uninitialized TermsEnum for a field before the first call to next() or seek().
FilteredTermsEnums cannot implement seek() as eg. NRQ or Automaton are not able to support this. Seeking is also not needed for MTQ at all, so seek can just throw UOE.
This issue changes some of the internal behaviour of MTQ and FilteredTermsEnum to allow also seeking in NRQ and Automaton (see comments below).
