Create ChainingCollector



Description:
ChainingCollector allows chaining a bunch of Collectors, w/o them needing to know or care about each other, and be passed into Lucene's search API, since it is a Collector on its own. It is a convenient, yet useful, class. Will post a patch w/ it shortly.
