ACL with glob restrictions does not work on '/'



Description:
i tried to define a ACL on '/' that would allow 'read' on '/' itself, but not for the nodes underneath. i tried "*", "/*", "./*" but none of them seem to do the desired effect.

eg:
everyone,allow,jcr:read, '/'
everyone,deny,jcr:read, '/', glob="/*"

the same works for a non-root node.
