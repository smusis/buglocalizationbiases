Method to create default RepositoryConfig from just the repository directory



Description:
It would be useful to have a static method like RepositoryConfig.create(File) that would take the repository directory and expect to find the repository configuration in a "repository.xml" file inside that directory.

If the directory does not exist, it would be created. And if the repository configuration file does not exist, then it would be created from the default configuration included in Jackrabbit.
