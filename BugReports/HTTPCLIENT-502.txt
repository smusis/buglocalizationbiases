HttpConnection isOpen flag concurrency problem



Description:
The HttpConnection.java class contains an isOpen boolean used to track the state
of the connection (opened or closed).  The problem is that in the
closeSocketAndStreams(), the flag is only flipped at the end of the
unsynchronized method (after resources have been released) which causes a
concurrency issue in flushRequestOutputStream() where the flag is checked first
and the the outputStream is accessed.

I'm providing a patch for this problem.
