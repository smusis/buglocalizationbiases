improve performance when saving a node with a large number of child nodes (e.g. > 10k child node entries)



Description:
JCR-307 brought a significant improvement WRT saving nodes with a large number of child nodes

unfortunately JCR-2579 broke part of the optimization (see NodeState.setChildNodeEntries(List)).
