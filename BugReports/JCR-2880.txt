Save fails after setting a binary property twice



Description:
Setting a binary property twice discards the blob value of the first property state but does not remove the change from the changelog, resulting in an error on save:

javax.jcr.RepositoryException: this BLOBFileValue has been disposed
	at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.value.RefCountingBLOBFileValue.copy(RefCountingBLOBFileValue.java:105)

will attach patch that adds the respective test to the jcr2spi tests.
