AttributeSource can have an invalid computed state



Description:
If you work a tokenstream, consume it, then reuse it and add an attribute to it, the computed state is wrong.
thus for example, clearAttributes() will not actually clear the attribute added.

So in some situations, addAttribute is not actually clearing the computed state when it should.
