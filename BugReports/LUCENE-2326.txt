Remove SVN.exe and revision numbers from build.xml by svn-copy the backwards branch and linking snowball tests by svn:externals



Description:
As we often need to update backwards tests together with trunk and always have to update the branch first, record rev no, and update build xml, I would simply like to do a svn copy/move of the backwards branch.

After a release, this is simply also done:
{code}
svn rm backwards
svn cp releasebranch backwards
{code}

By this we can simply commit in one pass, create patches in one pass.

The snowball tests are currently downloaded by svn.exe, too. These need a fixed version for checkout. I would like to change this to use svn:externals. Will provide patch, soon.
