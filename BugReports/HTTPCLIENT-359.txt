StringRequestEntity.getContentLength wrong for multibyte chars



Description:
When setting up a PostMethod containing a StringRequestEntity with umlauts and
charset UTF-8 the content-length header is wrong. It should be the number
of bytes, but is the number of chars by now.

(e.g.
Content-Type: text/xml; charset=UTF-8
body='Ã¤Ã¶Ã¼ÃÃÃÃ')

Bug-location: org.apache.commons.httpclient.methods.StringRequestEntity
