Similarity.java javadocs and simplifications for 4.0



Description:
As part of adding additional scoring systems to lucene, we made a lower-level Similarity
and the existing stuff became e.g. TFIDFSimilarity which extends it.

However, I always feel bad about the complexity introduced here (though I do feel there
are some "excuses", that its a difficult challenge).

In order to try to mitigate this, we also exposed an easier API (SimilarityBase) on top of 
it that makes some assumptions (and trades off some performance) to try to provide something 
consumable for e.g. experiments.

Still, we can cleanup a few things with the low-level api: fix outdated documentation and
shoot for better/clearer naming etc.
