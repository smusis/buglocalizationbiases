Generalize directory copy operation



Description:
The copy operation in RAMDirectory(Directory) constructor can be used more generally to copy one directory to another. Why bound it only to RAMDirectory?. For example, I build index in RAMDirectory but I need it to persist in FSDirectory. I created a patch to solve it.
