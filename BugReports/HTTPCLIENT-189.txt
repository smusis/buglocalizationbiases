Set-Cookie2 and Set-Cookie



Description:
Acording to RFC2965 9.1:
                                                 User agents that
   receive in the same response both a Set-Cookie and Set-Cookie2
   response header for the same cookie MUST discard the Set-Cookie
   information and use only the Set-Cookie2 information.

this is read that the header for a cetain cookie, but not all cookie.
So, Server can send only Set-Cookie header for some cookies and,
for cookies send Set-Cookie2,Set-cookie both.

But httpclient implementation handles this that if find any set-cookie2 header,
then ignores all Set-cookie header.
I know some sites use set-cookie2 only for cookies which needs
 more flexible exiration handling, and for other cookies use only
Set-Cookie. One of exmaples of such sites I know is 
TDNet Database service provided by Tokyo Stock Exchange.

So, the preferred implementation is that if set-cookie2 header
 found for a certain cookie then cookie value is set from set-cookie2 header, if
not, then from Set-Cookie header.
