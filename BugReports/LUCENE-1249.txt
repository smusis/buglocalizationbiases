Bugs in org.apache.lucene.index.TermVectorsReader.clone()



Description:
A couple of things:

- The implementation can return null which is not allowed.  It should throw a CloneNotSupportedException if that's the case.

- Part of the code reads:

    TermVectorsReader clone = null;
    try {
      clone = (TermVectorsReader) super.clone();
    } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {}

    clone.tvx = (IndexInput) tvx.clone();

If a CloneNotSupportedException is caught then "clone" will be null and the assignment to clone.tvx will fail with a null pointer exception.
