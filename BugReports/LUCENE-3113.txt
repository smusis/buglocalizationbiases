fix analyzer bugs found by MockTokenizer



Description:
In LUCENE-3064, we beefed up MockTokenizer with assertions, and I've switched over the analysis tests to use MockTokenizer for better coverage.

However, this found a few bugs (one of which is LUCENE-3106):
* incrementToken() after it returns false in CommonGramsQueryFilter, HyphenatedWordsFilter, ShingleFilter, SynonymFilter
* missing end() implementation for PrefixAwareTokenFilter
* double reset() in QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer and ReusableAnalyzerBase
* missing correctOffset()s in MockTokenizer itself.

I think it would be nice to just fix all the bugs on one issue... I've fixed everything except Shingle and Synonym
