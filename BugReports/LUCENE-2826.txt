LineDocSource should assign stable IDs; docdate field should be NumericField



Description:
Some small enhancements when indexing docs from a line doc source:

  * Assign docid by line number instead of by number-of-docs-indexed;
    this makes the resulting ID stable when using multiple threads

  * The docdate field is now indexed as a String (possible created
    through DateTools).  I added two numeric fields: one that indexes
    .getTime() (= long msec) and another that indexes seconds since
    the day started.  This gives us two numeric fields to play
    with...
