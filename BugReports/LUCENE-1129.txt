ReadTask ignores traversalSize



Description:
The ReadTask doLogic() method ignores the value of the traversalSize and loops over hits.length() instead, thus falsely reporting the desired number of iterations through the hit list.

The fix is relatively trivial since we already calculate 
{code}
int traversalSize = Math.min(hits.length(), traversalSize());
{code}
so we just need to use this value in the loop condition.
