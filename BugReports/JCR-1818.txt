Too many open files when merging large index segments



Description:
When large index segments are merged it may happen that lots of smaller index segments are created but have to wait until the large
index merge has completed. This may lead to a 'too many open files' exception on some system.

We should find a solution where large index merges are better decoupled from regular index operations.
