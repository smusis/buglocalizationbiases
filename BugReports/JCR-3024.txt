[SPI] Node.setProperty with null value throws ItemNotFoundException



Description:
Node.setProperty with a null value should not throw a ItemNotFoundException in the case a property with the given name does not exist. Rather should it return a stale property which throws an InvalidItemStateException when its methods are accessed. 

This behavior is also consistent with jackrabbit-core.
