RFC4918IfHeaderTest.testPutIfLockToken could fail with 412 Precondition Failed



Description:
In org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.server.RFC4918IfHeaderTest:110 (webdav-test), 
the lock request is initialized with a timeout of 1800 milliseconds, which is rounded as Timeout: Second-1 (at org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.header.TimeoutHeader:46).

The assertion in the finally block MUST fail (412, Precondition Failed) if the lock has expired (cf. RFC 4918, Section 10.4.10).

The lock request should be initialized with a higher timeout, at least several seconds.
