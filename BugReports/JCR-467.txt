CompactNodeTypeReader fails to explain why valid JCR names cause errors



Description:
for example, you cannot use underscores in node type definitions:
[my:example_breaks2]

In fact only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, : are allowed, unless you quote the name. The error message you see when you make this mistake doesn't give any hint:
Missing ']' delimiter for end of node type name (nodetypes.cnd, line 8)

and the documentation on the website and the javadoc for CompactNodeTypeDefReader both just say:

 * unquoted_string ::= ...a string...

... not helpful. If you made this mistake, you end up needing to look at the source to figure out what you've done wrong. 

A few suggested solutions:
- change the documentation to say unquoted string is '[A-Za-z0-9:]+'
- change the error message to mention the token causing the problem, eg:
if (!currentTokenEquals(Lexer.END_NODE_TYPE_NAME)) {
            lexer.fail("Missing '" + Lexer.END_NODE_TYPE_NAME + "' delimiter for end of node type name, found " + currentToken);
}
- add "st.wordChars('_','_');" to the lexer, its probably going to be the most common cause, and doesnt conflict with other rules.
