please log allocation of new connections to support debugging, testing



Description:
I'd like to suggest that the MultiThreaded connection manager emit a trace-level log when it 
allocates a new HttpConnection to support debugging and testing.  I added one while working on 
my integration in Apache Axis (see org.apache.axis.transport.http.CommonsHTTPSender) and 
figured this would be of general use.  I'll attach a patch with the oh-so-minor addition after 
submitting this enhancement request.
