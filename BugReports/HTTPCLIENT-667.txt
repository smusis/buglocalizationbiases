Provide BestMatch cookie policy



Description:
Presently HttpClient uses a single cookie policy for all target hosts, which is suboptimal for two reasons:
(1) the user needs to know beforehand what kind of HTTP cookie support the target host provides
(2) does not work well with multiple sites with different level of HTTP cookie support 

Introduce new cookie policy that dynamically picks up a CookieSpec (browser compatibility | Netscape draft | RFC2109 | RFC2965) based on properties of the response received from the target host
