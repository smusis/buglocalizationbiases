Problem getting the HTTPClient to use HTTP 1.0 with a proxy server



Description:
I am using HTTPClient 3.0-rc1.
I am connecting to an HTTPS site through a proxy.

I used HTTPLook to see the HTTP messages between the Proxy and the HTTPClient.
I noticed that it always used HTTP/1.1 and setVersion() on either the 
httpclient and the method do not help. I could not find how to get 
the HTTPClient to use HTTP/1.0 with the proxy.

Looking at the ConnectMethod class, the HTTP1.1 was indeed hardcoded.

Thanks
