simple improvements to tests



Description:
Simon had requested some docs on what all our test options do, so lets clean it up and doc it.

i propose:
# change all vars to be tests.xxx (e.g. tests.threadspercpu, tests.multiplier, ...)
# ensure all 6 build systems (lucene, solr, each solr contrib) respect these.
# add a simple wiki page listing what these do.
