Remove background initialization of hierarchy cache



Description:
This is a follow up to JCR-1998.

Rethinking the initialization in a background thread again, I now come to the conclusion that it should be initialized either completely on startup or not at all. A background thread puts additional load on the process, possibly fighting for I/O with other startup procedures.
