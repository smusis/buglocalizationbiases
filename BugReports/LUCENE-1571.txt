DistanceFilter problem with deleted documents



Description:
I know this is the locallucene lib, but wanted to make sure we don't get this bug when it gets into lucene contrib.

I suspect that the issue is that deleted documents are trying to be evaluated by the filter.  I did some debugging and I confirmed that it is bombing on a document that is marked as deleted (using Luke).


Thanks!

Using the locallucene library 1.51, I get a NullPointerException at line 123 of DistanceFilter
The method is 	public BitSet bits(IndexReader reader) 
The line is double x = NumberUtils.SortableStr2double(sx);

The stack trace is:
java.lang.NullPointerException
