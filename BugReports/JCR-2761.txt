add shortcut method to CndImporter which makes it easier to rereigster node types



Description:
CndImporter has a two argument registerNodeTypes method which is a nice shortcut, but in order to rereigster node types, you have to use the non-shortcut method. Attached patch adds a three-argument method which provide a shortcut for doing reregistration.
