CachingHttpClient leaks connections with stale-if-error



Description:
If you are using the "stale-if-error" Cache-control header and CachingHttpClient decides to use a stale cached response it does not clean up the existing backend response.

This bug causes connections to leak from the connection pool each time the stale-if-error flow is executed.
