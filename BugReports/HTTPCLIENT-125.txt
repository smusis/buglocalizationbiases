empty host header with ip address



Description:
file: HttpMethodBase.java method: addHostRequestHeader

HttpClient writes an empty Host header if the host is referred using IP address.
HTTP 1.1 RFC is not too clear what should be used in this case. However, other
HTTP 1.1 implementations (e.g. Java 1.4.0) uses IP address instead of dns name
in the header.

Furthermore, some HTTP server implementations (e.g. Jetty) will return "400 bad
request" if it encounters an empty Host header. That may be a bug in Jetty, but
it might be a good idea to use IP address in Host header to increase compability.
