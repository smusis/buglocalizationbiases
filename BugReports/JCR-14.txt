{XML|Object}PersistenceManager.destroy(*) may fail



Description:
The destroy methods of the ObjectPersistenceManager class try to delete their files without checking for their existence. This may result in a FileSystemException being thrown because according to the specification of FileSystem.deleteFile() a FileSystemException is thrown "if this path does not denote a file or if another error occurs."

While the Jackrabbit LocalFileSystem implementation silently ignores a request to delete a non-existing file, our internal implementation of the interface throws a FileSystemException in this case, which cause destroy to fail.

I suggest all destroy methods should be extended to first check for the existence of the file to prevent from being thrown.

Note: This not only applies to ObjectPersistenceManager but also to XMLPersistenceManager.
