Repository lock keeps file open



Description:
The RepositoryLock opens a RandomAccessFile, but does not close it. The problematic line is:

lock = new RandomAccessFile(file, "rw").getChannel().tryLock();

This is usually not a problem as the file will be closed when the RandomAccessFile object is garbage collected. However, if called a lot in a short time frame, this results in 'too many open files' in some environments (for example Linux).
