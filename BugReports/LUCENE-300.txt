[PATCH] Refactoring of SpanScorer



Description:
Refactored some common code in next() and skipTo(). 
Removed dependency on score value for next() and skipTo(). 
Passes all current tests at just about the same speed 
as the current version. Added minimal javadoc. 
 
Iirc, there has been some discussion on the dependency of next() 
and skipTo() on the score value, but I don't remember the conclusion. 
In case that dependency should stay in, it can be adapted 
in the refactored code.
