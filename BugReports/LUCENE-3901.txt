Add katakana stem filter to better deal with certain katakana spelling variants



Description:
Many Japanese katakana words end in a long sound that is sometimes optional.

For example, ãƒ‘ãƒ¼ãƒ†ã‚£ãƒ¼ and ãƒ‘ãƒ¼ãƒ†ã‚£ are both perfectly valid for "party".  Similarly we have ã‚»ãƒ³ã‚¿ãƒ¼ and ã‚»ãƒ³ã‚¿ that are variants of "center" as well as ã‚µãƒ¼ãƒ?ãƒ¼ and ã‚µãƒ¼ãƒ? for "server".

I'm proposing that we add a katakana stemmer that removes this long sound if the terms are longer than a configurable length.  It's also possible to add the variant as a synonym, but I think stemming is preferred from a ranking point of view.
