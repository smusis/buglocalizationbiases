Add sort missing first/last ability to SortField and ValueComparator



Description:
When SortField and ValueComparator use EntryCreators (from LUCENE-2649) they use a special sort value when the field is missing.

This enables lucene to implement 'sort missing last' or 'sort missing first' for numeric values from the FieldCache.
