some valid email address characters not correctly recognized



Description:
the EMAIL expression in StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex misses some unusual but valid characters in the left-hand-side of the email address. This causes an address to be broken into several tokens, for example:

somename+site@gmail.com gets broken into "somename" and "site@gmail.com"
husband&wife@talktalk.net gets broken into "husband" and "wife@talktalk.net"

These seem to be occurring more often. The first seems to be because of an anti-spam trick you can use with google (see: http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/08/gmail-plus-smart-trick-to-find-block.html). I see the second in several domains but a disproportionate amount are from talktalk.net, so I expect it's a signup suggestion from the service.

Perhaps a fix would be to change line 102 of StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex from:
EMAIL      =  {ALPHANUM} (("."|"-"|"_") {ALPHANUM})* "@" {ALPHANUM} (("."|"-") {ALPHANUM})+

to 

EMAIL      =  {ALPHANUM} (("."|"-"|"_"|"+"|"&") {ALPHANUM})* "@" {ALPHANUM} (("."|"-") {ALPHANUM})+

I'm aware that the StandardTokenizer is meant to be more of a basic implementation rather than an implementation the full standard, but it is quite useful in places and hopefully this would improve it slightly.
