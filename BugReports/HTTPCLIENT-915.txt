Provide a clean mechanism to attatch user define attributes to connections



Description:
It would be nice to have a way to attach user defined attributes to a connection.
Ideally it'd be nice if such support could be added to HttpClientConnection, but understandably this may not be possible due to back-compatibility issues.
So, we could have something like HttpConnectionContext perhaps (or similar) with:

HttpConnectionContext#setAttribute(String name, Object value)
Object HttpConnectionContext#getAttribute(String name)

This would be made available in the HttpContext of a request (like the connection is today):

HttpConnectionContext connectionContext = (HttpConnectionContext) httpContext.getAttribute(ExecutionContext.HTTP_CONNECTION_CONTEXT);

This would make a few things much cleaner to implement than they are today: The most obvious being my current use case of wanting connection isolated cookies.

Currently to achieve this goal we need to provide custom client connection + connection operator + connection manager implementations. Then there is no clean way to currently obtain the actual connection instance created by a custom operator in the HttpContext: As it's wrapped by the connection pool and #getWrappedConnection is protected - so we need to resort to reflection in interceptors.

Providing a clean mechanism for attaching user defined attributes to a connection instance as described above would make such implementations far far simpler.
