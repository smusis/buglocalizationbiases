Replace BundleFsPersistenceManager with DerbyPersistenceManager in the JR Core indexing tests



Description:
Running the JR Core tests yields a deprecation warning on account of workspace config being outdated for some indexing tests:

  INFO  o.a.j.core.config.BeanConfig - org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.pool.BundleFsPersistenceManager is deprecated. Please use org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle.BundleFsPersistenceManager instead

This shows up 3 times in the logs because there are 3 indexing related workspaces that need this config update.
