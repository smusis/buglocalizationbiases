JcrUtils.getRepository(...) for simple repository access



Description:
As discussed on the mailing list, it would be nice to have a trivially simple way (one line of code) to connect to a repository. The RepositoryFactory interface in JCR 2.0 defines a way for clients to get a repository reference without a direct implementation dependency, but a client still needs extra code to handle the Service Provider lookup and the iteration through all the available repository factories.

To simplify client code I'd like to introduce a JcrUtils.getRepository(Map<String, String>) method that takes care of the tasks mentioned above:

    Map<String, String> parameters = ...; // repository settings
    Repository repository = JcrUtils.getRepository(parameters);

As a further simplification, I'd also like to introduce a JcrUtils.getRepository(String) method that builds the parameter map based on a given "repository URI".

    Repository repository = JcrUtils.getRepository("file:///path/to/repository");

    Repository repository = JcrUtils.getRepository("http://localhost:8080/server");

The set of supported URI types is still to be defined.
