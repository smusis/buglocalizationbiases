Index nodes in parallel



Description:
CPUs with multiple cores are now standard and Jackrabbit should make use of it where it makes sense. Analyzing content while a node is indexed is quite costly, but can be broken easily into task that can be executed in parallel. E.g. index multiple nodes in parallel.
