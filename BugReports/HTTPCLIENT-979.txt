cache entry resource management should be extracted from CachingHttpClient



Description:
As we have built in support for stream-based management of cached response bodies, the CachingHttpClient class has its fingers in too many pies and is involved in resource management but not storage of the actual HttpCacheEntries.

I have a patch forthcoming. :)
