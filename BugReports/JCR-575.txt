unicode escapes in files generated by JJTree



Description:
Maven build fails on windows machines if sources are located in a directory starting with a 'u'. This is because files created by JJTree (javacc) put filename and path in a comment of the generated files, like this:

/*@bgen(jjtree) Generated By:JJTree: Do not edit this line. D:\usr\projects\workspace\jackrabbit\target\generated-src\main\org\apache\jackrabbit\core\query\sql\JCRSQL.jj */

The \u in interpreted as an escape characted and so you get a 
"BUILD FAILED ... Invalid escape character"
