SimpleWebdavServlet: avoid 404 for the root collection



Description:
in order to avoid strange 404 error when accessing the root collection in simple webdav servlet (thus missing workspace name), that request should either be redirected or handled by a create fake root that has no correspondance in the jsr170 repository.
