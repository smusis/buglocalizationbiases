Contrib: ThaiAnalyzer to enable Thai full-text search in Lucene



Description:
Thai text don't have space between words. Usually, a dictionary-based algorithm is used to break string into words. For Lucene to be usable for Thai, an Analyzer that know how to break Thai words is needed.

I've implemented such Analyzer, ThaiAnalyzer, using ICU4j DictionaryBasedBreakIterator for word breaking. I'll upload the code later.

I'm normally a C++ programmer and very new to Java. Please review the code for any problem. One possible problem is that it requires ICU4j. I don't know whether this is OK.
