XMLTextExtractor returns an empty reader when encoding is unsupported



Description:
XMLTextExtractor is failing to index xml files.  Searching for content in xml files is not coming back with results.

On the extractText(InputStream stream, String type, String encoding) method, the encoding is coming in as an empty string, and it throws an exception at line 62 (reader.parse(source)).

modifying the following statement fixes the problem:
before:  if (encoding != null) {
after:  if (encoding != null && !encoding.equals("")) {
