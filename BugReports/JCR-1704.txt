Indexing rules inheritance doesn't work



Description:
Indexing rules are supposed to be inherited by children node types.
In org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingConfigurationImpl.init, rules are registered for the declared node type and all its children. However, as the rule's node type is still the original one, the rule gets rejected in org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexingConfigurationImpl$IndexingRule.appliesTo.

One simple solution would be to register not the original rule, but a copy where the original node type has been replaced by the child one.

Please find corrected class attached.

Sincerely,

St√©phane
