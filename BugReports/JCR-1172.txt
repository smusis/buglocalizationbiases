Better MimeType Handling



Description:
After saving a Excel File through WebDAV the mimetype will be changed.
The mimetype for a Win2000 Exel File is application/vnd.ms-excel. This will be changed to application/msexcel.
Also problems makes the new office 07 format (docx,xlsx,pptx). They will also be changed to application/octet-stream (default mimetype).
We have a lot of file types that we store in jackrabbit that are not in the properties file (MSInfoPath-, OutlookMsg-, MsAccess-Files, ...)
I think it will be better to let the mimetype property untouched if a mimetype is present so we must not put all the possible mimetypes in the property file.
