Dead code in SpellChecker.java (branch never executes)



Description:
SpellChecker contains the following lines of code:

    final int goalFreq = (morePopular && ir != null) ? ir.docFreq(new Term(field, word)) : 0;
    // if the word exists in the real index and we don't care for word frequency, return the word itself
    if (!morePopular && goalFreq > 0) {
      return new String[] { word };
    }

The branch will never execute: the only way for goalFreq to be greater than zero is if morePopular is true, but if morePopular is true, the expression in the if statement evaluates to false.
