Leftover legacy enum in IndexReader



Description:
In IndexReader we still have some leftover "handmade" enum from pre-Java5 times. Unfortunately the Generics/Java5 Policeman did not notice it.

This patch is just code cleanup, no baclkwards breaks, as code using this enum would not see any difference (because only superclass changes).

I will commit this asap.
