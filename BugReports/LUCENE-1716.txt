Adding norms, properties indexing and writer.infoStream support to benchmark



Description:
I would like to add the following support in benchmark:
# Ability to specify whether norms should be stored in the index.
# Ability to specify whether norms should be stored for the body field (assuming norms are usually stored for that field in real life applications, make it explicit)
# Ability to specify an infoStream for IndexWriter
# Ability to specify whether to index the properties returned on DocData (for content sources like TREC, these may include arbitrary <meta> tags, which we may not want to index).

Patch to come shortly.
