Contribution: Efficient Sorting of DateField/DateTools Encoded Timestamp Long Values



Description:
Hello Tim,

As promised, the sort functionality for "long" values is included in the
attached files.

patchTestSort.txt contains the diff info. for my modifications to the
TestSort.java class

org.apache.lucene.search.ZIP contains the three new class files for
efficient sorting of "long" field values and of encoded timestamp
field values as "long" values.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,
Rus
