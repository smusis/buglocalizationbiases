NamespaceRegistryTest uses an invalid URI as namespace URI



Description:
The test cases use "www.apache.org/..." as a namespace URI, but this is not a URI.

Suggest to fix by using a proper URI, such as by prefixing with "http://".

A related question is what our expectation is for JCR implementations. Are they allowed to reject something that doesn't parse as a URI according to RFC3986?
