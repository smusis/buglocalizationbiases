False assertion of >0 position delta in StandardPostingsWriterImpl



Description:
StandardPostingsWriterImpl line 159 is:
{code:java}
    assert delta > 0 || position == 0 || position == -1: "position=" + position + " lastPosition=" + lastPosition;            // not quite right (if pos=0 is repeated twice we don't catch it)
{code}

I enable assertions when I run my unit tests and I've found this assertion to fail when delta is 0 which occurs when the same position value is sent in twice in arrow.  Once I added RemoveDuplicatesTokenFilter, this problem went away.  Should I really be forced to add this filter?  I think delta >= 0 would be a better assertion.
