Compressed entities are not being cached properly



Description:
org.apache.http.impl.client.cache.CacheValidityPolicy.contentLengthHeaderMatchesActualLength() returns false for entities decompressed by ContentEncodingHttpClient, because the length of decompressed entity stored in cache will be different from the length specified in the response header.
Consequently, gzipped/deflated entities will never be satisfied from the cache.

Proposed fix: introduce new field in HttpCacheEntry() - actualContentLength, and populate it with the actual content length rigth before the cache entry is stored in the cache. Change the org.apache.http.impl.client.cache.CacheValidityPolicy.contentLengthHeaderMatchesActualLength() method to compare
entry.getResource().length() with entry.getActualContentLength()
