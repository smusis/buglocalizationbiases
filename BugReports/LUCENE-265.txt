[PATCH] to remove synchronized code from TermVectorsReader



Description:
Otis,

here the latest and last patch to get rid of all synchronized code from
TermVectorsReader. It should include at least 3 files, TermVectorsReader.diff,
SegmentReader.diff and the new junit test case TestMultiThreadTermVectors.java.
The patch was generated against the current CVS version of TermVectorsReader and
SegmentReader. All lucene related junit tests pass fine.

best regards
Bernhard
