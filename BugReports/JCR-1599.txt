LuceneQueryBuilder assumes readability of root-Node to be granted in any case.



Description:
Have a User U. 
Have the User U denied to read "/".
Have the User U allowed to read "/home/u".

Any query of User U on this workspace fails with an AccessDeniedException.

The exception is caused by a call insided LuceneQueryBuilder on ln212:
NodeId id = ((NodeImpl) session.getRootNode()).getNodeId(); 

I couldn't find a specification that imposes the readability of root-node as a precondtion for query.
Therefore I consider this behavior as a bug.
