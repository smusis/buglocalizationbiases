Keep WebDAV exception causes



Description:
The DavMethodBase and ExceptionConverter classes in jackrabbit-webdav and jackrabbit-spi2dav don't include the cause when throwing an exception based on some caught cause. This makes it harder to identify what is causing a  particular problem. The attached patch fixes that.
