auto close idle connections



Description:
This has been mentioned several times on the mailing list (most recently here:
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=commons-httpclient-dev@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=5191
)
It is desirable for the http client to close it's connection after some
configurable idle time. Failing to do so causes the server (and every TCP
resource in between) to keep the socket open and possibly run out of resources
under load.

The HTTP 1.1 RFC has this to say under section 8.1.4:
Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will
   no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make
   this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making
   more connections through the same server. The use of persistent
   connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of
   this time-out for either the client or the server.

   When a client or server wishes to time-out it SHOULD issue a graceful
   close on the transport connection. Clients and servers SHOULD both
   constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and
   respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect
   the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource
   drain on the network.

The first sentence of the 2nd paragraph is interesting: how is the client
supposed to do a "graceful close"? Does it simply mean closing the socket?
One possiblity may be to issue a HTTP/OPTIONS * request with a Connection:close
header.
