Make DirectoryTaxonomyWriter's indexWriter member private



Description:
DirectoryTaxonomyWriter has a protected indexWriter member. As far as I can tell, for two reasons:

# protected openIndexWriter method which lets you open your own IW (e.g. with a custom IndexWriterConfig).
# protected closeIndexWriter which is a hook for letting you close the IW you opened in the previous one.

The fixes are trivial IMO:
# Modify the method to return IW, and have the calling code set DTW's indexWriter member
# Eliminate closeIW. DTW already has a protected closeResources() which lets you clean other resources you've allocated, so I think that's enough.

I'll post a patch shortly.
