NullPointerException in VirtualNodeTypeStateManager.nodeTypeRegistered



Description:
I am working on a custom persistence manager which requires an additional node type being registered. For performance reasons, the existence of this node type is verified during PersistenceManager.init.

Unfortunately this does not seem to work as the VirtualNodeTypeStateManager is not prepared to handle this situation at that point in time - the systemSession field seems to still be null.
