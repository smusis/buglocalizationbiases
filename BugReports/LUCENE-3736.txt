ParallelReader is now atomic, rename to ParallelAtomicReader and also add a ParallelCompositeReader (that requires LogDocMergePolicy to have identical subreader structure)



Description:
The plan is:
- Move all subreaders to ctor (builder-like API. First build reader-set, then call build)
- Rename ParallelReader to ParallelAtomicReader
- Add a ParallelCompositeReader with same builder API, but taking any CompositeReader-set and checks them that they are aligned (docStarts identical). The subreaders are ParallelAtomicReaders.
