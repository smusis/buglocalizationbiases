DirListingExportHandler: Should not implement PropertyHandler



Description:
issue found by Roland Porath:

if the DirListingExportHandler is used with some other collection nodetype that nt:folder (that may allow other properties) the list of dav properties obtained upon PROPFIND (being delegated to PropertyHandler) results in an imcomplete list.

since the only benefit of the DirListingExportHandler is to display something nice(?) upon a GET to a folder, i'd suggest to remove the implementation of PropertyHandler from the DirListingExportHandler.
