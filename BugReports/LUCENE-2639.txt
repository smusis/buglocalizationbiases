remove random juggling in tests, add -Dtests.seed



Description:
Since we added newIndexWriterConfig/newDirectory, etc, a lot of tests are juggling randoms around.

Instead this patch:
* changes it so LuceneTestCase[J4] manage the random.
* allow you to set -Dtests.seed=23432432432 to reproduce a test, rather than editing the code
* removes random arguments from newIndexWriterConfig, newDirectory.

I want to do this before looking at doing things like newField so we can vary term vectors, etc.

I also fixed the solr contrib builds so they arent hiding the exceptions i noted in SOLR-2002.
