FST should differentiate between final vs non-final stop nodes



Description:
I'm breaking out this one improvement from LUCENE-2948...

Currently, if a node has no outgoing edges (a "stop node") the FST
forcefully marks this as a final node, but it need not do this.  Ie,
whether that node is final or not should be orthogonal to whether it
has arcs leaving or not.
