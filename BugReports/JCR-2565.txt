spi2dav: Overwrite header T specified for MOVE and COPY causes failure if some API tests



Description:
failing tests are:

org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.WorkspaceCopySameNameSibsTest#testCopyNodesNodeExistsAtDestPath
org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.WorkspaceMoveSameNameSibsTest#testMoveNodesNodeExistsAtDestPath

those would be fixed by setting the overwrite header to F(alse)... however, this doesn't fit those cases where same-same
siblings would be allowed and the copy/move to a destination with existing item would succeed in JCR.
