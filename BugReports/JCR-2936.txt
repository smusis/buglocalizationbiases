JMX Bindings for Jackrabbit



Description:
There has been a slight interest in the past for adding JMX support.
This would be the first stab at it. It is a Top 15 slow query log. (the 15 part is configurable)

It is not enabled by default, so just being there should not affect the overall performance too much. You can enable it and play a little, tell me what you think.
I've also added a test case that does a duration comparison with and without the logger.

The most important part of this issue is that it should open the way for some proper monitoring tools support around queries, caches, anything/everything Jackrabbit.

As usual, please let me know what you guys think
