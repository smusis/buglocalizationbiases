Workspace{Copy|Move}VersionableTest assumptions on versioning



Description:
These test cases assume that an ancestor of a versioned node can be made versioned. This may not be true for all JCR compliant stores.

There should be a way to skip the test when it can not be executed.

One obvious approach would be to throw a NotExecutableException when the attempt to enable versioning on the parent fails. However this has the drawback that it can mask configuration errors.

Thoughts?
