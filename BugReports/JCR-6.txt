VersionIteratorImpl problem?



Description:
I meet with problem in VersionIterator:
Classic nextVersion()/hasNext() loop  for VersionIterator become endless. 

I think problem with peek/pop misprint:

    public Version nextVersion() {
.......
        InternalVersion ret = (InternalVersion) successors.<b>peek</b>();
......
    }

I change to
InternalVersion ret = (InternalVersion) successors.<b>pop</b>();
