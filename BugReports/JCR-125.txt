Repository holds onto Session instance after logout



Description:

After a call to Session.logout the Repository instance's activeSession map still holds a reference to the session. This causes a problem when trying to unlock nodes locked by another session, the addLockToken method rejects the lock token.

Looking at the code in Session.logout, it tries to notify SessionListeners about the logout but Repository, which implements the SessionListener interface and will remove a session on logout, doesn't register with the Session to receive the logout notification.
