Javadoc - Field constructor with Reader needs comment about retained reference



Description:
If you don't dig into the Lucene internals, it isn't obvious the Field constructor http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/api/org/apache/lucene/document/Field.html#Field%28java.lang.String,%20java.io.Reader%29 retains a reference to the reader for use later on. It would be useful to have a comment added to the Javadoc saying something like:

Note: A reference to java.io.Reader is retained by the field. Reader is read from when the Document which this field is added to is itself added to the index.

Without this, the caller is liable to do silly things like closing the stream after constructing the org.apache.lucene.document.Field.
