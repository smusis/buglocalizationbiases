setProperty("name", new Value[0], PropertyType.LONG) loses property type



Description:
Adding an empty multivalued property with a specific non-STRING type to an unstructured node (i.e. one with an UNDEFINED multivalued property definition) creates an empty multivalued property of type STRING.

In some cases keeping the explicit type information is important, so we should avoid losing it.
