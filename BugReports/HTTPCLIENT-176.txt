Unusual Http status line



Description:
The web server at http://alces.med.umn.edu/Candida.html returns the following
status line:

HTTP 200 Document follows

This page loads in the 3 browsers I tried (though Safari actually rendered the
headers).  The current version of HttpClient reads through the whole page
looking for a line that starts with HTTP/.  I don't know how big of a problem
this is, but it's a fairly easy fix.  Patch to follow.
