remove unused benchmark dependencies



Description:
Benchmark has a huge number of jar files in its lib/ (some of which even have different versions than the same libs used in e.g. solr)

But the worst thing is, most of these it doesn't even use.
* commons-collection: unused
* commons-beanutils: unused
* commons-logging: unused
* commons-digetser: unused
