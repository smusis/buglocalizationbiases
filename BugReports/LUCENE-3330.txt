revise Scorer visitor API



Description:
Currently there is an (expert) API in scorer to allow you to take a scorer, and visit its children etc (e.g. booleanquery).

I think we should improve this, so its general to all queries.

The current issues are:
* the current api is hardcoded for booleanquery's Occurs, but we should support other types of children (e.g. disjunctionmax)
* it can be difficult to use the API, because of the amount of generics and the visitor callback API. 
* the current API enforces a DFS traversal when you might prefer BFS instead.
