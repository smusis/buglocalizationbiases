Jcr-server: Parsing NodeTypeProperty not compliant with definition



Description:
Creating a new NodeTypeProperty from an existing DavProperty fails, since assumptions made are not compliant with definition:

a) nodetype name is always enclosed in a 'nodetypename' element
b) nodetype property may be empty, thus contain no 'nodetype' element.
