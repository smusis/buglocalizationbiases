You cannot sort on fields that don't exist



Description:
While it's possible to search for fields that don't exist (you'll get 0 hits),  
you'll get an exception if you try to sort by a field that has no values. The  
exception is this:  
  
if (termEnum.term() == null) {  
  throw new RuntimeException ("no terms in field " + field);  
}  
  
I'll attach a change suggested by Yonik Seeley that removes this exception. 
 
Also, the if-condition above is incomplete anyway, so currently the exception 
is not always thrown (as termEnum .term() might well be != null but point to a 
term in a different field already)
