light/minimal stemming for euro languages



Description:
The snowball stemmers are very aggressive and it would be nice if there were lighter alternatives.

Some applications may want to perform less aggressive stemming, for example:

Good, relevance tested algorithms exist and I think we should provide these alternatives.
