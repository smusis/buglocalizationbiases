Remove unused (and untested) methods from ReaderUtil that are also veeeeery ineffective



Description:
ReaderUtil contains two methods that are nowhere used and not even tested. Additionally those are implemented with useless List->array copying; ineffective docStart calculation for a binary search later instead directly returning the reader while scanning -- and I am not sure if they really work as expected. As ReaderUtil is @lucene.internal we should remove them in 3.x and trunk, alternatively the useless array copy / docStarts handling should be removed and tests added:

{code:java}
public static IndexReader subReader(int doc, IndexReader reader)
public static IndexReader subReader(IndexReader reader, int subIndex)
{code}
