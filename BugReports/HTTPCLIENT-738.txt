HostnameVerifier shouldn't shadow simple name of implemented interface



Description:
public interface HostnameVerifier extends javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier.

As Findbugs says:

Class names shouldn't shadow simple name of implemented interface

This class/interface has a simple name that is identical to that of an implemented/extended interface, except that the interface is in a different package (e.g., alpha.Foo extends beta.Foo). This can be exceptionally confusing, create lots of situations in which you have to look at import statements to resolve references and creates many opportunities to accidently define methods that do not override methods in their superclasses.
