Query dump failed with deep query tree



Description:
With a big query (more than 400 OR operands) the query dump failed.
The query dump is made at QueryImpl.execute (line 136)

It failed because of the constant PADDING at QueryTreeDump.visit(line 85).
The constant PADDING is a 255 character array, but in my program it would need it to be bigger.
I think putting it to 65535 would not be a problem : it would only take a little bit more memory.

This is the top of the stacktract for info:
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	at java.lang.System.arraycopy(Native Method)
	at java.lang.StringBuffer.append(StringBuffer.java:499)
	at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.QueryTreeDump.visit(QueryTreeDump.java:85)
	at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.OrQueryNode.accept(OrQueryNode.java:50)
	at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.QueryTreeDump.traverse(QueryTreeDump.java:263)
                     ...

This is not critical because I can avoid the dump by unactivating debug logs.
