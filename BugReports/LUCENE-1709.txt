The Lucene tests can be parallelized to make for a faster testing system.

Notes from Mike M.:

I'd love to see a clean solution here (the tests are embarrassingly
parallelizable, and we all have machines with good concurrency these
days)... I have a rather hacked up solution now, that uses
"-Dtestpackage=XXX" to split the tests up.

Ideally I would be able to say "use N threads" and it'd do the right
thing... like the -j flag to make.
