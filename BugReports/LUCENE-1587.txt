RangeQuery equals method does not compare collator property fully



Description:
The equals method in the range query has the collator comparison implemented as:
(this.collator != null && ! this.collator.equals(other.collator))

When _this.collator = null_ and _other.collator = someCollator_  this method will incorrectly assume they are equal. 

So adding something like
|| (this.collator == null && other.collator != null)
would fix the problem
