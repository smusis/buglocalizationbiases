Don't use ensureOpen() excessively in IndexReader and IndexWriter



Description:
A spin off from here: http://www.nabble.com/Excessive-use-of-ensureOpen()-td24127806.html.

We should stop calling this method when it's not necessary for any internal Lucene code. Currently, this code seems to hurt properly written apps, unnecessarily.

Will post a patch soon
