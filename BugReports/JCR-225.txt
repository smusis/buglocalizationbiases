LockInfo.logginOut(SessionImpl): javadoc does not correspond to executed code



Description:
/**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     * <p/>
     * When the owning session is logging out, we have to perform some
     * operations depending on the lock type.
     * (1) If the lock was session-scoped, we unlock the node.
     * (2) If the lock was open-scoped, we remove the lock token
     *     from the session.
     */
    public void loggingOut(SessionImpl session) {
        if (live) {
            if (sessionScoped) {
                lockMgr.unlock(this);
            } else {
                if (session.equals(lockHolder)) {
                    lockHolder = null;
                }
            }
        }
    } 


if (2) is true, the lockToken is not removed from the session (at least not within the method).
