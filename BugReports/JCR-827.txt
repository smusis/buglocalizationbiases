SetValueFormatExceptiontest.testNode() relies on addMixin(), does not allow specification of node type



Description:
SetValueFormatExceptiontest.testNode() has two flaws:

- it doesn't cope with cases where the created node already is mix:referenceable.

- it doesn't allow specification of the node typer to be created.
