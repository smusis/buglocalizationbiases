FST apis out of sync between trunk/3.x



Description:
Looks like the offender is LUCENE-3030 :)

Not sure if everything is generally useful but it does change the public API (e.g. you can specify FreezeTail to the super-scary Builder ctor among other things).

Maybe we should sync up for 3.x?
