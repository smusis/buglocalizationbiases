MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager setMaxTotalConnections() method doesn't work



Description:
The deprecated setMaxTotalConnections() method in the
MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager seems like it has no effect:

Here is the source code in the current version:

    public void setMaxTotalConnections(int maxTotalConnections) {
        this.params.getMaxTotalConnections();
    }

Shouldn't it look more like this?

    public void setMaxTotalConnections(int maxTotalConnections) {
        this.params.setMaxTotalConnections(maxTotalConnections);
    }
