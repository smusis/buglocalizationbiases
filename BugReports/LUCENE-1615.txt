deprecated method used in fieldsReader / setOmitTf()



Description:
setOmitTf(boolean) is deprecated and should not be used by core classes. One place where it appears is FieldsReader , this patch fixes it. It was necessary to change Fieldable to AbstractField at two places, only local variables.
