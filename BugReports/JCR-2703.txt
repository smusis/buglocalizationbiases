UserManagement: Add Membership Cache



Description:
due to weakreference nature of the group members, retrieving the groups a given authorizable is member is expensive as the corresponding
API call (Node#getWeakReferences) executes a query [fallback if search is disabled: traversing the complete group tree, which isn't for free either].

i would therefore suggest to add a cache (authorizable nodeId -> group nodeids) that is gets cleared upon any modification to group membership or
group removal and doesn't need any extra observation. this cache may potentially obsolete the principal-based cache in DefaultPrincipalProvider...
