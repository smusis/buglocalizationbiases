NTLM authentication failed due to closing of connection

Description:

When dealing with a NTLM proxy server that sends response back with lines:

14:51:27:750 << HTTP/1.0 407 Proxy Authentication Required
14:51:27:796 << Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2003 19:52:43GMT[\r][\n]
14:51:27:796 << Content-Length: 257[\r][\n]
14:51:27:796 << Content-Type: text/html[\r][\n]
14:51:27:796 << Server: NetCache appliance (NetApp/5.3.1R1)[\r][\n]
14:51:27:796 << Connection: keep-alive[\r][\n]
14:51:27:796 << Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM 
TlRMTVNTUAACAAAABgAGACgAAAAGggEAtOoNy4M0g0EAAAAAAAAAAEdMT0JBTA==[\r][\n]

The httpClient code is using the "HTTP/1.0" as clue for closing the connection 
and ignored the "Connection: keep-alive".  That caused the NTLM authentication 
to fail as the NTLM requires the response to the challenge to be sent back on 
the same connection.

Proposed Fix:

Our fix is to add a flag inProxyAuthenticationRetry (in HttpMethodBase) to 
indicate that the method is doing proxy authentication retry.  When the flag is 
true, in "HttpMethodBase.shouldCloseConnection", check the "Connection: keep-
alive" before determining to close the connection.
