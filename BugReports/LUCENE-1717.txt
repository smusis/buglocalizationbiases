IndexWriter does not properly account for the RAM consumed by pending deletes



Description:
IndexWriter, with autoCommit false, is able to carry buffered deletes for quite some time before materializing them to docIDs (thus freeing up RAM used).

It's only on triggering a merge (or, commit/close) that the deletes are materialized and the RAM is freed.

I expect this in practice is a smallish amount of RAM, but we should still fix it.

I don't have a patch yet so if someone wants to grab this, feel free!!
