Add a serializing content handler



Description:
Both JCR-1310 and JCR-1343 need XML serialization functionality and we've also previously (JCR-367, JCR-1086) implemented something similar.

It would be good to centralize such code, and so I'd like to use the already referenced code from Cocoon [1] as the basis for a SerializingContentHandler class in jackrabbit-jcr-commons.
