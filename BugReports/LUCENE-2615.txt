DirectIOLinuxDirectory hardwires buffer size and creates files with invalid permissions



Description:
TestDemo fails if I use the DirectIOLinuxDirectory (using Robert's new -Dtests.directory=XXX), because when it O_CREATs a file, it fails to specify the mode, so [depending on C stack!] you can get permission denied.

Also, we currently hardwire the buffer size to 1 MB (Mark found this)... I plan to add a "forcedBufferSize" to the DirectIOLinuxDir's ctor, to optionally override lucene's default buffer sizes (which are way too small for direct IO to get barely OK performance).  If you pass 0 for this then you get Lucene's default buffer sizes...
