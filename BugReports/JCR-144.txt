Path parser does not allow trailing slashes



Description:
The current implementation of the Path class violates the spec in that the trailing slashes are not allowed while the path syntax clearly allows trailing slashes.

(Of course the Path class violates the spec in another way, too, in that it allows for the root path "/" to be valid while the path syntax in the spec does not allow that, which is clearly an error of the spec of course).
