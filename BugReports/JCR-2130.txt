Node.removeMixin() should not remove valid items



Description:
assume you define a mixin like:

[test] mix
- aprop (string)
+ anode (nt:base)

and you add this mixin to a nt:unstructured and add 'anode' and set 'aprop'.
then a subsequent node.removeMixin("test") will also remove 'anode' and 'aprop' although they are valid by the definition of nt:unstructured.

imo, the items should only be removed if they become invalid by the definition of the resulting effective node type.
