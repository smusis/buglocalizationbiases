[contrib-bdb] initialization fails if directory doesn't exist



Description:
BerkeleyDBPersistenceManager initialization fails if the directory configured doesn't exist (this doesn't happen with other PMs).
This can easily be fixed in the persistence manager, by making it create all the directories in the path (actually it only creates the last -db- directory).

The trivial patch is to replace envDir.mkdir() to envDir.mkdirs() (note the final "s") at BerkeleyDBPersistenceManager  line 73:
        if (!envDir.exists())
            envDir.mkdir();
should be:
        if (!envDir.exists())
            envDir.mkdirs();

(I am not submitting any svn diff since the manual fix sounds so trivial, it's easier to change it manually)
