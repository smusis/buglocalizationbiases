'100-continue' response times out unexpectedly



Description:
Entity encosing methods time out (3 seconds) rather than getting the
100-continue response. Then, after it has send the body, the 100-continue
response is received and returned.

Adding

  method.setUseExpectHeader(false);

seems to fix it.
