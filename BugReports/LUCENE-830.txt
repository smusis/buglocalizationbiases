norms file can become unexpectedly enormous



Description:

Spinoff from this user thread:

Norms are not stored sparsely, so even if a doc doesn't have field X
we still use up 1 byte in the norms file (and in memory when that
field is searched) for that segment.  I think this is done for
performance at search time?

For indexes that have a large # documents where each document can have
wildly varying fields, each segment will use # documents times # fields
seen in that segment.  When optimize merges all segments, that product
grows multiplicatively so the norms file for the single segment will
require far more storage than the sum of all previous segments' norm
files.

I think it's uncommon to have a huge number of distinct fields (?) so
we would need a solution that doesn't hurt the more common case where
most documents have the same fields.  Maybe something analogous to how
bitvectors are now optionally stored sparsely?

One simple workaround is to disable norms.
