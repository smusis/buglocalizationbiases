shouldn't automatically set Content-Length in request header



Description:
currently, httpclient automatically add Content-Length: 0 in the request 
header, this is causing problems with some web servers, particularly, with

ar.atwola.com

Try the following URL
http://ar.atwola.com/file/adsWrapper.js

It will block indefinitely. This problem can be fixed by not sending the 
Content-Length header, this is the browser's behavior. I'm not sure why this 
casue problem, but let's conform to a standard browser's practice and avoid 
troubles.
