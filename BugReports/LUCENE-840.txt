contrib/benchmark unit tests



Description:
The need came up in this thread: 
http://www.mail-archive.com/java-dev@lucene.apache.org/msg09260.html

: We might want to start thinking about Unit Tests...  :-)  Seems kind
: of weird to have tests for tests, but this is becoming sufficiently
: complex that it should have some tests.
