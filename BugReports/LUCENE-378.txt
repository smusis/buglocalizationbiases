GCJ makefile hardcodes compiler commands



Description:
src/gcj/Makefile hardcodes the command names for gcj, gcjh, and g++. This makes it difficult to 
compile with a particular version of GCJ if multiple are installed with suffixes (eg, gcj-4.0)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Configure, compile, and install GCC/GCJ with something like --program-suffix=-4.0
2. cd ~/src/lucene && ant gcj

Expected results:
Somehow be able to specify my compiler.

Actual results:
Can't find 'gcj' executable, or worse runs wrong version. :)

Suggested fix: as is common with variable names like CC to force a C compiler, allow the builder to 
override the compiler commands used by setting optional environment variables GCJ etc.
Patch to be attached.
