CMS should default its maxThreadCount to 1 (not 3)



Description:
From rough experience, I think the current default of 3 is too large.  I think we get the most bang for the buck going from 0 to 1.

I think this will especially impact optimize on an index with many segments -- in this case the MergePolicy happily exposes concurrency (multiple pending merges), and CMS will happily launch 3 threads to carry that out.
