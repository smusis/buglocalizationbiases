Implement jcr-jackrabbit://... repository URIs



Description:
The current file://... URIs used by the Jackrabbit RepositoryFactoryImpl class make it hard to support extra ?parameters and prevent other JCR implementations from using similar repository URI patterns.

Thus I propose that we start supporting a jcr-jackrabbit://... URI pattern in addition to the current file://... pattern.
