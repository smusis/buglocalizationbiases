Standardize on a common mocking framework (either EasyMock or Mockito)



Description:
We are currently using EasyMock in the caching module and Mockito in the main module. While Mockito appears to have a somewhat nicer API, the sheer number of test cases based on EasyMock in the caching module makes it much simpler to replace Mockito with EasyMock than the other way around.
