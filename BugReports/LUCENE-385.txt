[PATCH] don't delete all files in index directory on index creation



Description:
Many people use Lucene to index a part of their file system. The chance that  
you some day mix up index directory and document directory isn't that bad.  
Currently Lucene will delete *all* files in the index directory when the  
create paramater passed to IndexWriter is true, thus deleting your documents 
if you mixed up the parameters. I'll attach a patch that fixes  
this. Any objections?
