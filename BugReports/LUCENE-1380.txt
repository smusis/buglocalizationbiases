Patch for ShingleFilter.enablePositions (or PositionFilter)



Description:
Make it possible for *all* words and shingles to be placed at the same position, that is for _all_ shingles (and unigrams if included) to be treated as synonyms of each other.

Today the shingles generated are synonyms only to the first term in the shingle.
For example the query "abcd efgh ijkl" results in:
   ("abcd" "abcd efgh" "abcd efgh ijkl") ("efgh" efgh ijkl") ("ijkl")

where "abcd efgh" and "abcd efgh ijkl" are synonyms of "abcd", and "efgh ijkl" is a synonym of "efgh".

There exists no way today to alter which token a particular shingle is a synonym for.
This patch takes the first step in making it possible to make all shingles (and unigrams if included) synonyms of each other.
