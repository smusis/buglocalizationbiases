remove IndexSearcher.docFreq/maxDoc



Description:
As pointed out by Mark on SOLR-1632, these are no longer used by the scoring system.

We've added new stats to Lucene, so having these methods on indexsearcher makes no sense.
Its confusing to people upgrading if they subclassed IndexSearcher to provide distributed stats,
only to find these are not used (LUCENE-3555 has a correct API for them to do this).

So I think we should remove these in 4.0.
