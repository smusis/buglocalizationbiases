Catch Throwables while calling TextExtractors



Description:
There are different Exception Handlings in the current TextExtractors.
The Method Signature throws IOException but the internal Handling is different.

For example in the MsExcelTextExtractor there will be RuntimeException's catched but not in all Extractors.
@see JCR-574

I think we should catch Throwables in the NodeIndexer to prevent OutOfMemoryErros while indexing a node.
