ValueFormat should provide method getJCRString



Description:
In order to retrieve the JCR String representation of a QValue currently the following calls are required:

ValueFormat.getJCRValue(QValue, NamePathResolver, ValueFactory)
Value.getString()

This could be simplified if the ValueFormat would provide

ValueFormat.getJCRString(QValue, NamePathResolver)
