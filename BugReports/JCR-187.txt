it is not possible to register an event listener which listens to mixin nodetypes



Description:
it would be a nice enhancement if one could as well define mixin nodetypes to be listened:
...
om.addEventListener(this,
                        Event.PROPERTY_ADDED | Event.PROPERTY_CHANGED | Event.PROPERTY_REMOVED,
                        "/",
                        true,
                        null,
                        new String[]{"mix:Custom"},
                        false);
...
