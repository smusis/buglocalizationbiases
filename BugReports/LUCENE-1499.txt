Minor refactoring to IndexFileNameFilter



Description:
IndexFileNameFilter looks like it's designed to be a singleton, however its constructor is public and its singleton member is package visible. The proposed patch changes the constructor and member to private. Since it already has a static getFilter() method, and no code in Lucene references those two, I don't think it creates any problems from an API perspective.
