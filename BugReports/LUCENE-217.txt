[PATCH] new method: Document.remove()



Description:
Here's a patch that adds a remove() method to the Document class (+test case). This 
is very useful if you have converter classes that return a Lucene Document object but 
you need to make changes to that object. 
 
In my case, I wanted to index PDF files that were saved as BLOBs in a database. The 
files need to be saved to a temporary file and that file name is given to the PDF 
converter class. The PDF converter then saves the name of the temporary file name 
as the file name, which doesn't make sense. So my code needs to remove the 
'filename' field and re-add it, this time with the columns primary ID. This is only possible 
with the attached patch.
