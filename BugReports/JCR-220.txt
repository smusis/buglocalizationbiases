Make it possible to configure Lucene Analyzer for SearchIndex



Description:
Jackrabbit does not support the specification of a Lucene analyzer class (org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer) to be used by a SearchIndex (or other Lucene based indices) declared in an XML configuration file. Custom analyzer is useful for indexing language specific content.
