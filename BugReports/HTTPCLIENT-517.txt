Cookie Documentation clarifications



Description:
The JavaDoc for CookieSpec mentions that the default policy is RFC2109 - it
would be nice if this was mentioned on
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/cookies.html as well
(likewise for 2.0)

The Javadoc for getDefaultPolicy() says to use getCookieSpec(String); it would
be better to say to use getCookieSpec(DEFAULT), and it would be helpful to
mention getDefaultSpec().

CookiePolicy Javadoc does not mention the IGNORE_COOKIES policy in the header
documentation.

The cookies.html page mentions automatic and manual handling of cookies, but
does not provide any links as to how to control these. For example, how does one
turn off automatic cookie handling?
