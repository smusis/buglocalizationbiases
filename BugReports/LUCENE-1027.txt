contrib/benchmark config does not play nice with doubles with the flush.by.ram value



Description:
In the o.a.l.benchmark.byTask.utils.Config.java file, the nextRound and various other methods do not handle doubles in the "round" property configuration syntax.

To replicate this, copy the micro-standard.alg and replace 
merge.factor=mrg:10:100:10:100
max.buffered=buf:10:10:100:100

with

ram.flush.mb=ram:32:40:48:56

and you will get various ClassCastExceptions in Config (one in newRound() and, when that is fixed, in getColsValuesForValsByRound.

The fix seems to be to just to mirror the handling of int[].

The fix seems relatively minor.  Patch shortly and will plan to commit tomorrow evening.
