disable positions for spellchecker ngram fields



Description:
In LUCENE-2391 we optimized spellchecker (re)build time/ram usage by omitting frequencies/positions/norms for single-valued fields,
among other things.

Now that we can disable positions but keep freqs, we should disable them for the n-gram fields, because the spellchecker does
not use positional queries.
