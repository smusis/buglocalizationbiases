DefaultRequestDirector converts redirects of PUT/POST to GET for status codes 301, 302, 307



Description:
The DefaultRequestDirector treats redirect requests created by all redirect status codes (HttpStatus.SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY: , HttpStatus.SC_MOVED_PERMANENTLY, HttpStatus.SC_SEE_OTHER, HttpStatus.SC_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT) the same, converting PUT/POST methods to GET.  The HttpClient Tutorial even documents this as being in accordance with the specification, but I don't believe that's true.

Per the RFC (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html), conversion of PUT/POST to GET is appropriate only for 303 (See Other).  The others do not suggest this behavior.  In fact, the following notes attached to them call it out as incorrect.

301 (Moved Permanently) has this note:

      Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after
      receiving a 301 status code, some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents
      will erroneously change it into a GET request.

And 302 (Found) say this:

      Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
      to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
      existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
      response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
      of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
      been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
      kind of reaction is expected of the client.

The currently implemented behavior is causing problems with interacting with Central Authentication Service protected resources, among other things.
