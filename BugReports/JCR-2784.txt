NodeStateMerger.merge should abort if the primary type of the 2 states to be compare are not the same



Description:
the NodeStateMerger#merge currently aborts if the mixin types of the passed state and its overlayed state are not equal.
as of jsr 283 not the only the mixin types but also the primary type of a node can be modified.

for consistency reasons NodeStateMerger#merge should abort and return false if the primary types are not the same.
