Proxy-Authorization header received on server side



Description:

 
 I'm following example
 http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/examples.html
 Proxy authentication
 
 but it seems that not only proxy is receiving credentials for proxy.
 In log, which is generated at target.host I can see header
 Proxy-Authorization: Basic ....

--------- HEADER
Host:target.host:443
Connection:Keep-Alive
User-Agent:Apache-HttpClient/4.1 (java 1.5)
Proxy-Authorization:Basic Z
--------- POST
