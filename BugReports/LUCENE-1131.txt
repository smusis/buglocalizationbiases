Add numDeletedDocs to IndexReader



Description:
Add numDeletedDocs to IndexReader. Basically, the implementation is as simple as doing:
public int numDeletedDocs() {
  return deletedDocs == null ? 0 : deletedDocs.count();
}
in SegmentReader.
Patch to follow to include in all IndexReader extensions.
