HttpClient should always override the host of HostConfiguration if an absolute request URI is given



Description:
This bug most likely occurs on all patforms and OS's, but I have only tested it
on WinXP.

The HttpClient.executeMethod(HostConfiguration,HttpMethod,HttpState) will
receive and throw an IllegalArgumentException stating that "host parameter is
null" when a  HostConfiguration object is passed in that ONLY has a proxy set
(via HostConfiguration.setProxy(String, int)). Details to reproduce follow--the
bug can be easily reproduced by using the Apache Axis 1.2 CommonsHTTPSender
class (with JVM system props http.proxyHost, http.proxyPort set):

There is a bug in the Apache Commons HTTP Client 3.0rc2 that does not set the
hostname property
in the <code>HostConfiguration</code> object if the following two steps
are performed:<br>
1. You call
<code>HttpClient.executeMethod(HostConfiguration,HttpMethod,HttpState)</code>
with a <code>HostConfiguration</code> object and an <code>HttpMethod</code> object
(created using the HttpMethod(String uri) constructor).This method 
is called in this exact way in the Apache Axis 1.2 client
(CommonsHTTPSender.java lines 132 and 186).<br>
2. That <code>HostConfiguration</code> object only has a proxy set (using
setProxy(String, int)). This method 
is called in this exact way in the Apache Axis 1.2 client
(CommonsHTTPSender.java line 389).<br>

Apache Axis 1.2rc3 CommonsHTTPSender.java did not expose this bug in Commons
HTTP Client 3.0rc2 because
it set the <code>HostConfiguration</code> in a different manner, as follows:<br>
1. Call <code>HttpClient.setHostConfiguration(HostConfiguration)</code> first.
Again,
The <code>HostConfiguration</code> object must only have a proxy set and no host
name.<br>
2. Then call <code>HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpMethod)</code>.<br>

Using the above steps (as in Axis 1.2rc3 CommonsHTTPSender.java, invoke()
method), line 379 in HttpClient.java evaluates to true
because the argument <code>hostConfiguration</code> is null (see line 324 in
HttpClient.java) and the local 
variable <code>defaultHostConfiguration</code> ==
<code>HttpClient.setHostConfiguration(HostConfiguration)</code>
which was set in item #1 above. The hostname then gets set in the
<code>HostConfiguration</code>
object in line 384 of HttpClient.java.
