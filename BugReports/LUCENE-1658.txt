Absorb NIOFSDirectory into FSDirectory



Description:
I think whether one uses java.io.* vs java.nio.* or eventually
java.nio2.*, or some other means, is an under-the-hood implementation
detail of FSDirectory and doesn't merit a whole separate class.

I think FSDirectory should be the core class one uses when one's index
is in the filesystem.

So, I'd like to deprecate NIOFSDirectory, absorbing it into
FSDirectory, and add a setting "useNIO" to FSDirectory.  It should
default to "true" for non-Windows OSs, because it gives far better
concurrent performance on all platforms but Windows (due to known Sun
JRE issue http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6265734).
