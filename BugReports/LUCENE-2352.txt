Add a new TestBackwardsCompatibility index for flex backwards (a 3.0 one with also numeric fields)



Description:
In flex we change also the encode/decoder for numeric fields (NumericTokenSteam) using BytesRef and also the collation filters. We should add a test index from 3.0 that contains these fields and do some validation, that field contents did not change when read with flex.
