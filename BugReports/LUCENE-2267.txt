Add solr's artifact signing scripts into lucene's build.xml/common-build.xml



Description:
Solr has nice artifact signing scripts in its common-build.xml and build.xml.

For me as release manager of 3.0 it would have be good to have them also when building lucene artifacts. I will investigate how to add them to src artifacts and maven artifacts
