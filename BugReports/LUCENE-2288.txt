Create EMPTY_ARGS constsant in SnowballProgram instead of allocating new Object[0]



Description:
Instead of allocating new Object[0] create a proper constant in SnowballProgram. The same (for new Class[0]) is created in Among, although it's less critical because Among is called from static initializers ... Patch will follow shortly.
