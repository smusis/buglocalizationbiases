Improve payload error handling/reporting



Description:
If you try to load a payload more than once you get the exception:  IOException("Payload cannot be loaded more than once for the same term position.");

You also get this exception if their is no payload to load, and its a bit confusing, as the message doesn't relate to the actual problem.
