Remove benchmark/lib/xml-apis.jar - JVM 1.5 already contains the required JAXP 1.3 implementation

xml-apis.jar is not needed with xerces-2.9 and Java 5, as Java 5 already has these interface classes (JAXP 1.3). Xerces 2.11 needs it, because it ships with Java 6's JAXP release (containing STAX & Co. not available in Java 5).

since we are on java 5 since 3.0
we have the javax APIs already available in the JVM
xerces until 2.9.x only needs JAXP 1.3
so the only thing you need is xercesImpl.jar
and serializer.jar
serializer.jar is shared between all apache xml projects, dont know the exact version number
ok you dont need it whan you only parse xml
as soon as you want to serialize a dom tree or result of an xsl transformation you need it
[...]
but if we upgrade to latest xerces we need it [the xml-apis jar] again unless we are on java 6
so the one shipped with xerces 2.11 is the 1.4 one
because xerces 2.11 supports Stax
