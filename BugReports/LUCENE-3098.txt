Grouped total count



Description:
When grouping currently you can get two counts:
* Total hit count. Which counts all documents that matched the query.
* Total grouped hit count. Which counts all documents that have been grouped in the top N groups.

Since the end user gets groups in his search result instead of plain documents with grouping. The total number of groups as total count makes more sense in many situations.
