DateField class should be public



Description:
The class org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.DateField should be made public.  It has several public methods which are useful but are currently not accessible because the class itself is not accessible outside of its package.  All of the other Field classes in that package are public and accessible (LongField, DoubleField, etc.)
