SegmentReader.doCommit should be sync'd; norms methods need not be sync'd



Description:
I fixed the failure in TestNRTThreads, but in the process tripped an assert because SegmentReader.doCommit isn't sync'd.

So I sync'd it, but I don't think the norms APIs need to be sync'd -- we populate norms up front and then never change them.  Un-sync'ing them is important so that in the NRT case calling IW.commit doesn't block searches trying to pull norms.

Also some small code refactoring.
