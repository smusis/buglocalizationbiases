Add support for Ideographic Space to the queryparser - also know as fullwith space and wide-space



Description:
The Ideographic Space is a space character that is as wide as a normal CJK character cell.
It is also known as wide-space or fullwith space.This type of space is used in CJK languages.

This patch adds support for the wide space, making the queryparser component more friendly
to queries that contain CJK text.

Reference:
'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)' - see Table of spaces, char U+3000.

I also added a new testcase that fails before the patch.
After the patch is applied all junits pass.
