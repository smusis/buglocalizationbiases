automaton spellchecker



Description:
The current spellchecker makes an n-gram index of your terms, and queries this for spellchecking.
The terms that come back from the n-gram query are then re-ranked by an algorithm such as Levenshtein.

Alternatively, we could just do a levenshtein query directly against the index, then we wouldn't need
a separate index to rebuild.
