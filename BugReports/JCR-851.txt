Handling of binary properties (streams) in QValue interface



Description:
The current SPI requires QValue to return new streams upon each call to getStream(). As far as I can tell, this essentially requires a QValue implementation to preserve the whole content of a stream, be it in memory or on disk.

In particular (and unless I'm missing something), when importing large content into a repository, this causes the whole data stream to be written twice. We really should try to avoid that.
