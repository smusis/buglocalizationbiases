cache module should strip 'Content-Encoding: identity' from responses



Description:
Per the RFC, the "identity" content coding SHOULD NOT be used in the Content-Encoding header:

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.5

The current implementation will pass 'Content-Encoding: identity' through unchanged, although it would be simple enough to filter this out.
