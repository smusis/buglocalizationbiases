Improve error messages for index aggregates



Description:
In the case where an index aggregate fails because of a node that doesn't exist the logged warn messages contain a full stack-trace.
Besides the fact that this can be misleading (you may think that there's something wrong that you need to fix right away) it is also borderline useless.

The desired behavior would be to just log an "info" message mentioning that a certain node was skipped, similar to what the SeachManager does.
