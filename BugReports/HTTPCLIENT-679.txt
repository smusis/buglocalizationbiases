URI Absolutization does not follow browser behavior



Description:
This was encountered using Heritrix to crawl a prominent website.

The URI resulting from the HttpClient URI constructor (base, relative) does not follow browser behavior:
URI newUrl = new URI(new URI("http://www.theirwebsite.com/browse/results?type=browse&att=1"), "?sort=0&offset=11&pageSize=10")

Results in newUrl:
http://www.theirwebsite.com/browse/?sort=0&offset=11&pageSize=10

The desired behavior based on Firefox and IE should be:
http://www.theirwebsite.com/browse/results?sort=0&offset=11&pageSize=10

These browsers treat the question mark similar to a directory separator and do not require a file to be specified before the query.

HttpClient's current behavior does not correspond to current browser behavior and leads to an inability to crawl certain websites if HttpClient's URI class is used.
