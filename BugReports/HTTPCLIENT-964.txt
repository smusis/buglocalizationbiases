no-cache directives with field names are transmitted downstream



Description:
"Field names MUST NOT be included with the no-cache directive in a request."

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.4

Currently, the cache implementation allows a request containing something like:
    Cache-Control: no-cache="Content-Location"
to be passed downstream towards the origin.

This is another one of those tricky situations where our client has passed us a non-compliant request.
