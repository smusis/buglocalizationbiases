Cannot clone BasicClientCookie2 without specified ports



Description:
The clone method returns a null pointer exception when called on a BasicClientCookie2 that does not use any ports properties.
In other words, it is impossible to clone a BasicClientCookie2 instance without ports specification.

In the clone() method, they are two main instructions :
 - calling clone() method on super
 - calling clone() method on the ports integer array (which is null)

It may be a good idea to check whether the array is null or not
