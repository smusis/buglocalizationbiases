SessionImpl#isSupportedOption: Skip descriptor evaluation if descriptor has not been loaded



Description:
followup issue for JCR-3076.

as jukka stated changing the jcr-server to serve the repository-descriptor without mandating a successful login would
require quite some changes on the server side as the current flow demands a successful repository login in order
to be access any resource including the root resource that acts as parent for all (available) workspaces. since the
repository-descriptor report has be requested one of the resources it also mandates a successful login although
retrieving descriptors on the jcr-level is possible when just having the repository at hand.

on the other hand i would assume that the descriptor functionality present on the Repository is rarely used.
therefore i would suggest to just relax the check for supported options in the jcr2spi session implementation
and skip the evaluation if the descriptor isn't available at all. consequently the failure of a non-supported
feature would be postponed to the point it reaches the SPI (instead of informing the API consumer upfront). 
on the other hand supported operations would not fail just because the descriptors have not been loaded.
