Set default precisionStep for NumericField and NumericRangeFilter



Description:
This is a spinoff from LUCENE-1701.

A user using Numeric* should not need to understand what's
"under the hood" in order to do their indexing & searching.

They should be able to simply:
{code}
doc.add(new NumericField("price", 15.50);
{code}

And have a decent default precisionStep selected for them.

Actually, if we add ctors to NumericField for each of the supported
types (so the above code works), we can set the default per-type.  I
think we should do that?

4 for int and 6 for long was proposed as good defaults.

The default need not be "perfect", as advanced users can always
optimize their precisionStep, and for users experiencing slow
RangeQuery performance, NumericRangeQuery with any of the defaults we
are discussing will be much faster.
