Break the spi2dav dependency to jcr-server



Description:
Currently the spi2dav component has a dependency on the jcr-server component, which is troublesome due to the extra transitive dependencies and which strictly speaking should not be necessary from an architectural point of view.

The dependency exists mostly for sharing a number of JCR-specific WebDAV constants. I'd like to push those constants down to jackrabbit-webdav as they are essentially just shared strings and as jackrabbit-webdav already contains a number of constants used by JCR extensions.

In addition to constant values, code in the following classes is shared between jcr-server and spi2dav: JcrValueType, NamespacesProperty, NodeTypesProperty, SearchResultProperty, SubscriptionImpl, ValuesProperty. The shared code in JcrValueType and SubscriptionImpl is mostly just about mapping constant value mappings and could fairly easily be moved to jackrabbit-webdav. The Property classes are a but trickier, but it looks like it would be possible to split the code to separate server- and client-side classes for jcr-server and spi2dav.
