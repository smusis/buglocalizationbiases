[PATCH] fixes for gcj target.



Description:
I've modified the Makefile so that it compiles with GCJ-4.0.

This involved fixing the CORE_OBJ macro to match the generated jar file as well
as excluding FieldCacheImpl from being used from its .java source (GCJ has
problems with anonymous inner classes, I guess).

Also, I changed the behaviour of FieldInfos.fieldInfo(int). It depended on
catching IndexOutOfBoundsException exception. I've modified it to test the
bounds first, returning -1 in that case. This helps with gcj since we build with
-fno-bounds-check.

I compiled with;

GCJ=gcj-4.0 GCJH=gcjh-4.0 GPLUSPLUS=g++-4.0 ant clean gcj

patch to follow.
