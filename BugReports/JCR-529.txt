New versions added after a restore have bad version name



Description:
I add several versions to a node (1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4). Perform a restore to version 1.2 and add more versions. After that VersionHistory is like this:

- 1.0
- 1.1
- 1.2
- 1.3
- 1.4
- 1.3.1
- 1.3.2
- 1.3.3
- 1.3.4
- 1.3.5

New versions should be 1.2.x no 1.3.x, isn't it?
