A tokenfilter to decompose compound words



Description:
A tokenfilter to decompose compound words you find in many germanic languages (like German, Swedish, ...) into single tokens.

An example: Donaudampfschiff would be decomposed to Donau, dampf, schiff so that you can find the word even when you only enter "Schiff".

I use the hyphenation code from the Apache XML project FOP (http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/) to do the first step of decomposition. Currently I use the FOP jars directly. I only use a handful of classes from the FOP project.

My question now:
Would it be OK to copy this classes over to the Lucene project (renaming the packages of course) or should I stick with the dependency to the FOP jars? The FOP code uses the ASF V2 license as well.

What do you think?
