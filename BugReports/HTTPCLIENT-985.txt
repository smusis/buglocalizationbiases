cache module should populate Via header to capture upstream and downstream protocols



Description:
Because the cache module is currently implemented as a decorator that behaves like a transparent caching proxy, we need it to correctly populate the Via header so that we can preserve the record of which protocol versions were used upstream and downstream from the caching module.

This is a MUST per the RFC:
http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.45
