[PATCH] Exception not thrown where it appears it should have been



Description:
Code creates an expection in an apparent error state, but doesn't throw it when it looks like it should

class: org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.jcr.search.SearchResultProperty
ctor: public SearchResultProperty(DavProperty property, ValueFactory valueFactory) throws RepositoryException
around line 96

        } else {
            new IllegalArgumentException("SearchResultProperty requires a list of 'dcr:column' xml elements.");
        }

Patch fixes this
