bad normalization in sorted search returning TopDocs



Description:
FieldSortedHitQueue.maxscore is maintained in the lessThan method (which never gets called if a single document is added to the queue).

I've checked in a test to TestSort.testTopDocsScores() with the final assertion commented out.
