Grouping module should allow subclasses to set the group key per document



Description:
The new grouping module can only group by a single-valued indexed field.

But, if we make the 'getGroupKey' a method that a subclass could override, then I think we could refactor Solr over to the module, because it could do function queries and normal queries via subclass (I think).

This also makes the impl more extensible to apps that might have their own interesting group values per document.
