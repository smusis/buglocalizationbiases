Add System.getProperty("tempDir") as final static to LuceneTestCase(J4)



Description:
Almost every test calls System.getProperty("tempDir") and some of them check the return value for null. In other cases the test simply fails from within eclipse.

We should add this to LuceneTestCase(J4) as a static final constant. For enabling tests run in eclipse, we can add a fallback to ".", if the Sysprop is not defined.
