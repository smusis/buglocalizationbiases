TCK: observation tests are too restrictive



Description:
The basic sequence in all observation tests is:

1) add listener
2) modify workspace
3) remove listener
4) wait for events on listener

This sequence forces an implementation to maintain a logical order for listener registrations and content changes. In the light of the asynchronous nature of observation events this seems too restrictive for certain implementations.

The sequence should be changed to:

1) add listener
2) modify workspace
3) wait for events on listener
4) remove listener

Which is also more intuitive from a user perspective.
