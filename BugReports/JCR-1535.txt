Some tests assume that an implementation of javax.jcr.Item overrides equals()



Description:
The following 3 tests (followed by the line number containing the bad assertion):

org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.ReferencesTest.testReferenceTarget:135
org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.ReferencesTest.testAlterReference:169
org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.version.VersionHistoryTest:152

assume that an implementation of javax.jcr.Item overrides equals(), such that 

Assert.assertEquals(n1, n2) or 
java.util.Set.contains(n1) 

works for two "equal" nodes n1,n2 or for some node n1 that has been previously put into a set. However, there is no section in the specification that would mandate this. The tests above should therefore replace assertEquals() with one of the other mechanism that officially supported, such as javax.jcr.Node.isSame().
