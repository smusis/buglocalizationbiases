Optimize queries that check for the existence of a property



Description:
//*[@mytext] is transformed into the org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.MatchAllQuery, that through the MatchAllWeight uses the MatchAllScorer.  The calculateDocFilter() in MatchAllScorer  does not scale and becomes slow for growing number of nodes. 

Solution: lucene documents will get a new Field:

public static final String PROPERTIES_SET = "_:PROPERTIES_SET".intern();

that holds the available properties of this document. 

NOTE: Lucene indices build without this performance improvement should still work and fall back to the original implementation
