FieldInfo omitTerms bug



Description:
Around line 95 you have:

    if (this.omitTf != omitTf) {
      this.omitTf = true;                // if one require omitTf at least once, it remains off for life
    }

Both references of the omitTf booleans in the if statement refer to the same field. I am guessing its meant to be other.omitTf like the norms code above it.
