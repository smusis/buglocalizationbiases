If the NRT reader hasn't changed then IndexReader.openIfChanged should return null



Description:
I hit a failure in TestSearcherManager (NOTE: doesn't always fail):

{noformat}
  ant test -Dtestcase=TestSearcherManager -Dtestmethod=testSearcherManager -Dtests.seed=459ac99a4256789c:-29b8a7f52497c3b4:145ae632ae9e1ecf
{noformat}

It was tripping the assert inside SearcherLifetimeManager.record,
because two different IndexSearcher instances had different IR
instances sharing the same version.  This was happening because
IW.getReader always returns a new reader even when there are no
changes.  I think we should fix that...

Separately I found a deadlock in
TestSearcherManager.testIntermediateClose, if the test gets
SerialMergeScheduler and needs to merge during the second commit.
