support stores where binary properties are mandatory (such as in nt:resource)



Description:
SetValueBinaryTest tries to remove binary properties by setting them to null. However, some stores only support binary properties in the case of jcr:content/jcr:data, in which case the property can not be removed directly.

Suggestion: check for mandatory/protected, and throw NotExecutableException in that case.
