Append-only index updates



Description:
Currently index updates modify some existing files. This is troublesome in scenarios like a backup or when an index will be shared in a cluster (though this is not yet the case).

Requirements are:

- index segments need a custom (lucene) IndexDeletionPolicy to keep index commits for a given time.
- index segments are not only referenced by their name, but also with their generation
- the segments file must now also record the generation of a segment. the file itself must be generational itself.
- purging of outdated index segment commits
