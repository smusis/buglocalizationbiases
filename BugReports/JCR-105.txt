QueryHandler.init() should take a context argument



Description:
Currently the QueryHandler.init() method takes a bunch of arguments which are needed by the single jackrabbit implementation for the query handler. To make further extensions easier the arguments should be packaged into a context class which can be extended without effect on the QueryHandler interface.
