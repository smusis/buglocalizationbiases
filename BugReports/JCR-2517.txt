UserImporter should use User.changePassword



Description:
the UserImporter lists a limitation that the password value is expected to be hashed already as it writes the
value as it was retrieved from the xml-import.

Instead it could make use of User#changePassword that (in the implementation present with JR) creates a 
pw-hash if the password is found to be plain text.
