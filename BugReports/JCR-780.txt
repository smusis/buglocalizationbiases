Simultaneous updates by multiple sessions might not appear in the journal



Description:
In a clustering environment, simultaneous updates by multiple sessions in the same cluster node might not appear in the journal, because only record at a time can be handled by the cluster's workspace-specific callback method. When such a situtation arises, the following warnings can be found in the log:

*WARN * ClusterNode: No record created.
*WARN * ClusterNode: No record prepared.
