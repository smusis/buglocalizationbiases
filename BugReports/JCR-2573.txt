Performance of AC Evaluation



Description:
1. Performance in access control evaluation
=====================================================================

 - main focus on
   > read performance
   > resource-based access control in .a.j.c/s/authorization/acl/*

 - comparison admin vs. anonymous with full permissions
 - comparision between shortcut and ACL-evaluation.
 - comparison JR 1.4 vs JR 2.0 [actually i will compare Day's CRX as it already provided
   some custom AC stuff with JR 1.4]


2. Potential Problems
=====================================================================

   I would expect the most significant problems to be found in

a) ACLProvider#retrieveResultEntries: calculating effective ACEs
     for each session separately.

b) AclPermission:
     Each instance registering an event listener in order to
     keep the result cache up to date

c) AclPermission:
     Resolution form Path to Item or to nearest existing Item
