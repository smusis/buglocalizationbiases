Remove Maven 1 files



Description:
Now that we have a working Maven 2 build environment (JCR-332) we should remove the old Maven 1
project files to avoid confusion and misunderstandings. The old Maven 1 build environment doesn't even
work anymore.

Unless anyone objects, I'll proceed to remove the project.xml, maven.xml, and project.properties files in a few days.
