Redesign of HTTP authentication framework



Description:
The existing HTTP authentication framework has got a few glaring deficiencies:
- Authentication headers management evolved (or degraded) into a some sort of
black art and proved very error-prone.
- Existing logic intended to deal with authentication failures and
authentication failure recovery is flawed. The resolution of the HTTPCLIENT-213 did
appear possible without a better approach than the one based on AuthScheme#getID.

On top of that authentication logic got quite messy with the series of attempts
to fix breakages in complex authentication schemes (the latest being NTLM proxy
+ basic host fix) 

The patch I am about to attach is an attempt to address all the shortcomings
mentioned above. It builds upon my previous patch that enabled authentication
schemes to maintain authentication state and presents a complete redesign of the
existing HTTP authentication framework.

Basically there's no authentication code left untouched, so please do take a
closer look. Critique, comments, suggestions welcome.
