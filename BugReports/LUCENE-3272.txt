Consolidate Lucene's QueryParsers into a module



Description:
Lucene has a lot of QueryParsers and we should have them all in a single consistent place.  

The following are QueryParsers I can find that warrant moving to the new module:

- Lucene Core's QueryParser
- AnalyzingQueryParser
- ComplexPhraseQueryParser
- ExtendableQueryParser
- Surround's QueryParser
- PrecedenceQueryParser
- StandardQueryParser
- XML-Query-Parser's CoreParser

All seem to do a good job at their kind of parsing with extensive tests.

One challenge of consolidating these is that many tests use Lucene Core's QueryParser.  One option is to just replicate this class in src/test and call it TestingQueryParser.  Another option is to convert all tests over to programmatically building their queries (seems like alot of work).
