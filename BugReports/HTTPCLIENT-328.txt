Proxy tunneling/auth with CONNECT for non-HTTP protocols



Description:
HttpClient would be even more useful if it supported connections tunneled 
through proxies and proxy authentication for non-HTTP protocols. E.g. Binary 
protocols such as SSH or JXTA-TCP could be tunneled through a web proxy if 
HttpClient provided access to the underlying Socket after the negotiations 
(auth, CONNECT) with the web proxy were complete.
