Implement a way to override or resolve DNS entries defined in the OS



Description:
When working with HttpClient in restrictive environments, where the user doesn't have the permissisions to edit the local /etc/hosts file or the DNS configuration, can be eased with an DNS Overrider capability. 

This can be useful with JMeter which can follow redirects automatically and resolve some of the redirected hosts against its configuration. Another example is a custom forward proxy, written in Java and based on httpclient, which can be deployed is such a restricted environment that would ease the development of various web solutions for some developers.
