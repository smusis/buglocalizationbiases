Realm from authentication challenge unavailable



Description:
There is currently no way to extract the authentication realm from HttpClient 
except to extract the authentication challenge header and parse it manually.

Either the realm needs to be available to the client or a method in 
Authenticator should extract the realm from a given authentication header.

The same problems occurs with determining which type of authentication is 
being used and what other options there are (basic, digest, NTLM, others).
