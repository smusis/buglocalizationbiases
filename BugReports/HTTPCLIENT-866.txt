HttpClient depends on jcip-annotations.jar



Description:
When using Java 5 to compile code that uses HttpClient, jcip-annotations.jar must be in the classpath or else you get a compiler error:

    [javac] /path/to/src/SomeFile.java:129: cannot access net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy
    [javac] file net/jcip/annotations/GuardedBy.class not found
    [javac]         DefaultHttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
    [javac]                                        ^


With Java 6, you get a bunch of warnings instead.
    [javac] org/apache/http/impl/client/AbstractHttpClient.class(org/apache/http/impl/client:AbstractHttpClient.class): warning: Cannot find annotation method 'value()' in type 'net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy': class file for net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy not found


This requirement doesn't seem to be documented anywhere, and jcip-annotations.jar is not included in the "httpcomponents-client-4.0-bin-with-dependencies" package.
