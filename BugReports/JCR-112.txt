add target jvm in maven properties for compilation



Description:
actually the compatibility level for sources/binaries is not defined in project.properties, so if you compile jackrabbit with a 1.5 jdk it will not run on older vm.

It would be nice to add the following properties to assure that the generated jar will work on different jvms:
maven.compile.target=1.4
maven.compile.source=1.4

(or 1.3 if you are targetting also java 1.3)
