Code cleanup from all sorts of (trivial) warnings



Description:
I would like to do some code cleanup and remove all sorts of trivial warnings, like unnecessary casts, problems w/ javadocs, unused variables, redundant null checks, unnecessary semicolon etc. These are all very trivial and should not pose any problem.

I'll create another issue for getting rid of deprecated code usage, like LuceneTestCase and all sorts of deprecated constructors. That's also trivial because it only affects Lucene code, but it's a different type of change.

Another issue I'd like to create is about introducing more generics in the code, where it's missing today - not changing existing API. There are many places in the code like that.

So, with you permission, I'll start with the trivial ones first, and then move on to the others.
