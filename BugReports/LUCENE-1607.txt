String.intern() faster alternative



Description:
By using our own interned string pool on top of default, String.intern() can be greatly optimized.

On my setup (java 6) this alternative runs ~15.8x faster for already interned strings, and ~2.2x faster for 'new String(interned)'
For java 5 and 4 speedup is lower, but still considerable.
