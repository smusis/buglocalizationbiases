don't silently merge session-local transient changes with external changes before save().



Description:
currently, external changes (i.e. changes committed by other sessions) are silently merged with transient changes. this might potentially cause concurrency issues/inconsistent transient state (see e.g. JCR-2632).

it would probably be better to isolate transient changes from external changes until they're saved (true copy-on-write).
