introduce HttpRoutePlanner interface



Description:
Define an interface to determine a route for a given target host.
Create default implementation replacing DefaultHttpClient.determineRoute(...);
Implementations will need access to params and/or request.

The interface fits into HttpConn, but DHC.dR(...) uses client parameters.
Either move parameters to HttpConn, or keep default implementation in HttpClient.

Alternative implementations could evaluate Java system properties related to proxy settings.
