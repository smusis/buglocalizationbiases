Need setURI() methods in HttpMethod interface



Description:
I'd like to have the methods setURI( URI ) and setURI( String ) methods. Also a 
method like getRequestURI() because the uri I get now with the method getURI() 
changes if I execute a request which will be automatically forwarded.

The methods setURI can throw an exception if it has already been executed.
