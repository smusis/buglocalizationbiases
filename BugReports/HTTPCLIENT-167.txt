SSL Tunneling does not work with MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager



Description:
The HttpConnection is released prematurely when doing SSL tunneling with the
MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.  The ConnectMethod releases the connection
in responseBodyConsumed() before it can be used by the real method.
