[PATCH] FilteredTermEnum code cleanup



Description:
FilteredTermEnum's constructor takes two parameters but doesn't use them. This 
patch changes that and thus makes the code easier readable. Maybe the old 
constructor should be kept (as deprecated)? I'm not sure, this version seems 
cleaner to me.
