entity returns the same stream for getContent()



Description:
BasicHttpEntity and GzipDecompressingEntity will return the same stream
when getContent() is called multiple times. That is not allowed by the
HttpEntity interface. They should rather throw an IllegalStateException.

Some tests and EntityUtils rely on getContent to return the same stream
for multiple calls.

patch follows,
