TCK: XPath order by test uses non-standard column specifier mechanism



Description:
org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.QueryXPathOrderByTest generates a queries of the following form: /jcr:root/*[@proname]/@propname order by @propname

This syntax for column specifiers is not mandated by the JCR specification and will fail on any implementation that does not support it.

Instead the tests should use the following query: /jcr:root/*[@proname] order by @propname and then read the results using QueryResults.getNodes and not QueryResults.getRows.
