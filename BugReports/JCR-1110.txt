GetReferencesNodeTest test assumptions



Description:
Bad test assumptions in GetReferencesNodeTest:

1) In setUp(): there is a primary node type including mixin:versionable. Proposed fix: just create the node, try to add mixin:versionable, check the node type after save.

2) The repository supports non-protected reference properties. Proposed fix: check with AbstractJCRTest's ensureCanSetProperty method, and let NotExecutableException be thrown.
