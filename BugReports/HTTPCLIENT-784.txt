Multipart post is broken



Description:
I tried to do HttpPost request with MultipartEntity, this request was encoded to wire with 3 line separators after header and not processed correctly by http server.
MultipartEntry add 1 extra line separator before write itself to wire. I'm not sure about standards, but it is at least not "browser compatible".
