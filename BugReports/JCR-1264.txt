IfHeader: Incorrect test for parsing keyword "not" in parseIfList



Description:
The test for the "not" keyword tests the last character as

     (not !='t' || not != 'T')

which always yields true (not cannot be t and T at the same time). The correct test would be

     (not !='t' && not != 'T')
