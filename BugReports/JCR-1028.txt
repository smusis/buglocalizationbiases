Remove WARN logs for missing text extractors



Description:
In jackrabbit-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/query/lucene/JackrabbitTextExtractor.java, the method extractText logs at WARN level when no indexer is available.

Can we move this to DEBUG, as not all applications need full text indexing of the text nodes and this message fills the logs?
