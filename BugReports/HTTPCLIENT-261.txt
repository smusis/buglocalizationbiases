infinite loop on 302 redirect with different host in Location: header



Description:
Using the CVS version - 2.1 rc I think.

Trying to get the url contents for a url with followRedirects specified and 
StrictMode off and I get a 302 redirect to a different url with a different 
host in the Location header causes it to go into an infinite loop (mercifully 
aborting at 100 redirects).  An example offending url: 

http://www.snowcrest.net/mice/mice.htm

The problem lies in HttpMethodBase.java version 1.177 at line 1225.  It does 
the following:

        if (getRequestHeader("host") != null) {
            LOG.debug(
                "Request to add Host header ignored: header already added");
            return;
        }

and there is already the Host header from the previous url request so it 
endlessly loops until it aborts at the max redirects (default is 100 I guess).  
I commented this out and it worked fine.
