Mixin removal exception



Description:
When trying to remove a mixin from a non nt:unstructured node (in my case nt:resource), you get the following exception:

Unable to alter mixin types: javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: no matching property definition found for {http://www.day.com/jcr/cq/1.0}lastRolledout

lastRolledout property is defined by the mixin cq:LiveRelationship that I am trying to remove.
