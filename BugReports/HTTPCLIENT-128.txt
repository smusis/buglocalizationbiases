Redirection of a POST method



Description:
I execute a PostMethod to an URL which redirects me to a HTML page. If I set 
follow redirects to true the HttpClient wants to execute once more a POST. Of 
course a POST is not allowed to HTML pages. I think the HttpClient should 
exectue a GET method instead. That's also what is in the RFC2616:

10.3 Redirection 3xx

   This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be
   taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.  The action
   required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction
   with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is
   GET or HEAD. A client SHOULD detect infinite redirection loops, since
   such loops generate network traffic for each redirection.

      Note: previous versions of this specification recommended a
      maximum of five redirections. Content developers should be aware
      that there might be clients that implement such a fixed
      limitation.
