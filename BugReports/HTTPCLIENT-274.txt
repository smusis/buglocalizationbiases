default behaviour of useExpectHeader



Description:
I suggest to set the ExpectContinueMethod.setUseExpectHeader per default to
false or to arrange that per default it is not used. We lost an awfull lot of
time in a project in which we used MultipartPostMethod via a proxy. Everthing
worked fine in dev, however as soon as we started to use the proxy in production
or testing environment we had severe problems. We lost several manday looking
for the problem, including sniffing and logging op the proxy. It ended up to be
the useexpectheader which was true per default. Putting in on false ended our
problems...

In my opinion it is a bit hard to make something default behaviour if the
javadoc warns : <snip>
handshake should be used with caution, as it may cause problems with HTTP
servers and proxies that do not support HTTP/1.1 protocol.
