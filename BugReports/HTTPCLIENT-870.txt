Incorrect Specification-Title headers in MANIFEST.MF



Description:
The Specification-Title headers in MANIFEST.MF should all include the full project name, i.e.

Apache HttpComponents ...

The "HttpComponents" qualifier is missing; at present the entries are:

Specification-Title: Apache HttpClient
Specification-Title: Apache HttpMime

If present, Implementation-Title should follow the same convention.
