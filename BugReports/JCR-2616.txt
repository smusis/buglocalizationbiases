ItemInfoCacheImpl.getNodeInfo() and .getPropertyInfo() might not clear all relevant entries



Description:
ItemInfoCacheImpl.getNodeInfo() and .getPropertyInfo() remove the retrieved entry from the cache.

since entries might be cached by id AND path, entires identified by path are not removed from the cache if they're retrieved by id.
