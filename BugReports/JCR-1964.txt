VirtualNodeTypeStateProvider creates PropertyState with type != value(s).getType



Description:
VirtualNodeTypeStateProvider creates the item states for the in content representation of the node type definitions and in case of jcr:defaultValues hard codes the type of the property state (thus the jcr property) to PropertyType.STRING.

the nt-definition of nt:propertyDefinition however states that jcr:defaultValues doesn't have a required type, thus the type should rather be determined based on the values themselves.

the current behaviour leads situations where

Property.getType != Property.getValues()[0].getType()

which from my point of view is a bug.
