Support multi-selector OR constraints in join queries



Description:
Our current join implementation doesn't support OR constraints that refer to more than one selector. For example the following query is not possible:

    SELECT a.* FROM [my:type] AS a INNER JOIN [my:type] as b ON a.foo = b.bar WHERE a.baz = 'x' OR b.baz = 'y'

This limitation is a result of the way the join execution splits the query into per-selector components and merges the result based on the given join condition.

A simple but often inefficient solution would be to process such OR constraints as post-processing filters like we already do for some other more complex constraint types.
