spi2dav: EventFilters not respected



Description:
i have the impression that the event filter passed to the event subscription in spi2dav is not (or not properly) respected.

marcel, is there a specific reason that you always pass the static SubscriptionInfo constant (no node type filter, noLocal false) to the SubscribeMethod
in spi2dav/RepositoryServiceImpl#createSubscription ?

i guess this is the reason for the failure of
  testNodeType(org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.observation.AddEventListenerTest)
  testNoLocalTrue(org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.observation.AddEventListenerTest)
