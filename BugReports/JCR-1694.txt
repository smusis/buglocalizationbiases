System properties does not get replaced in a Cluster configuration



Description:
Since JCR-1304 has been added to jackrabbit 1.4 I guess this should be reported as a bug...

Still not debugged deeply, but if I try to configure a Cluster using:
<Cluster id="${server}" syncDelay="10">

after setting a "server" system property I expect to have the cluster initialized properly using the value of such property... I just realized that my cluster node gets initialized with the final value of "${server}" instead :(

Cluster config is a very good place where to use system properties, since all the configuration is usually identical between cluster nodes while the "id" property must be different...

Is there anything I missed/did wrong in my configuration?
