principalbased ACL editing fails if principalName differs from the authorizableID



Description:
this issue has been reported by alexK:

editing the permissions for a principal whose name differs from the id of the corresponding user/group fails with AccessControlException.

i quickly had a look at it and the main problem is caused by the ACEditor that assumes that the last segment of the 
path corresponds to the principal name. this isn't true if the principalName differs from the id.
