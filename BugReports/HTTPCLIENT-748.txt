make SchemeRegistry friendlier for DI frameworks



Description:
Scheme's in SchemeRegistry are registered via 'register' method, but there is no way to pass it a set of schemes so those can be registered in one step. This way it can be externally configured and 'spring/guice friendly'... something like this is sufficient...

public void setSchemes (final Set <Scheme> schemes) {
    for (final Scheme scheme : schemes) 
        register(scheme);    
}
