FileDataStore: garbage collection can delete files that are still needed



Description:
It looks like the FileDataStore garbage collection (both regular scan and persistence manager scan) can delete files that are still needed.

Currently it looks like the reason is the last access time resolution of the operating system. This is 2 seconds for FAT and Mac OS X, NTFS 100 ns, and 1 second for other file systems. That means file that are scanned at the very beginning are sometimes deleted, because they have a later last modified time then when the scan was started.
