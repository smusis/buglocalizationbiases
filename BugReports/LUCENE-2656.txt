If tests fail, don't report about unclosed resources



Description:
LuceneTestCase ensures in afterClass() if you closed all your directories, which in turn will check if you have closed any open files.

This is good, as a test will fail if we have resource leaks.

But if a test truly fails, this is just confusing, because its usually not going to make it to the part of its code where it would call .close()

So, if any tests fail, I think we should omit this check in afterClass()
