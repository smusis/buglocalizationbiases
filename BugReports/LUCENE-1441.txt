KeywordTokenizer does not set start/end offset of the Token it produces



Description:
I think just adding these two lines in the next(Token) method is the right fix:

           reusableToken.setStartOffset(0);
           reusableToken.setEndOffset(upto);

I don't think this is a back compat issue because the start/end offset are now meaningless since they will inherit whatever the reusable token had previously been used for.
