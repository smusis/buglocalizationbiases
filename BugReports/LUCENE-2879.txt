MultiPhraseQuery sums its own idf instead of Similarity.



Description:
MultiPhraseQuery is a generalized version of PhraseQuery, and computes IDF the same way by default (by summing across the terms).

The problem is it doesn't let the Similarity do this: PhraseQuery calls Similarity.idfExplain(Collection<Term> terms, IndexSearcher searcher),
but MultiPhraseQuery just sums itself, calling Similarity.idf(int, int) for each term.
