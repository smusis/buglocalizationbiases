PropertyState binary type desirialsation only returns half of content



Description:
Create a PropertyState for a binary Property (e.g jcr:data) set a value larger than the BLOBFileValues#MAX_BUFFER_SIZE  (e.g. 300Kbyte) serialse it.
On deserialisation the resulting PropertyState's InternalValue's size is only half as the origianl (e.g. 150Kbyte)

Most probably this is due to the States InputStream implementation marking bytes twice to be read.
Following fix solves the issue for call to #read(byte[], in, int),
but other Stream methods may fail as well.
