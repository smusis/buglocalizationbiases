questionable default value for BufferedOutputStream size in HttpConnection



Description:

Hi Eric

Thanks for bringing this up. HttpClient 3.0 allows for parameterization
of SO_SNDBUF and SO_RCVBUF settings. For HttpClient 2.0 (as well as for
3.0 when falling back onto the system defaults), however, it would make
sense to set a cap on the size of the send and receive buffers.

Feel free to open a ticket for this issue with Bugzilla
