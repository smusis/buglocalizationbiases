TaxonomyReader.refresh() is broken, replace its logic with reopen(), following IR.reopen pattern



Description:
When recreating the taxonomy index, TR's assumption that categories are only added does not hold anymore.
As result, calling TR.refresh() will be incorrect at best, but usually throw an AIOOBE.
