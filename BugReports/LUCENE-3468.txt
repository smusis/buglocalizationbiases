FirstPassGroupingCollector should use pollLast()



Description:
Currently FirstPassGroupingCollector uses last and remove method (TreeSet) for replacing a more relevant grouping during grouping.
This can be replaced by pollLast since Lucene trunk is now Java 6. TermFirstPassGroupingCollectorJava6 in Solr can be removed as well.
