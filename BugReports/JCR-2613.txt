NoSuchItemStateException on checkin after removeVersion in XA Environment



Description:
After removing a version, a checkin on the same node in a different transaction (with a different session) fails.
The NoSuchItemStateException refer to the uuid of the previously removed version. 
I'll attach a test demonstrating the problem.
