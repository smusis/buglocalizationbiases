update tests so that both Query.XPATH and Query:SQL are treated as optional features



Description:
In JCR 2.0, both Query.XPATH and Query.SQL are optional (or, actually, deprecated).

We either need to modify the tests so that they pass on a repository that doesn't support them (-> NotExecutableException), or remove them altogether.
