JCA project tests assume Windows paths



Description:
The org.apache.jackrabbit.jca package in the top-level jca directory has unit tests that assume a Windows environment. It should be fixed to work in any environment. The best solution may be to use a test repository configuration file in the current directory.

The following is the start of the test case failures that I got running on MacOS X.

Testsuite: org.apache.jackrabbit.jca.test.ConnectionFactoryTest
Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 3, Time elapsed: 0.778 sec
