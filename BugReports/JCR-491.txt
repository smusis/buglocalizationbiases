TCK: PredefinedNodeTypeTest does not allow additions to the predefined node types hierarchy



Description:
As explained in section 6.7.22.2 (page 147) of the JSR 170 specification, an implementation is allowed to customize a predefined noe type definition with additional supertypes. The tests in PredefinedNodeTypeTest do not account for that and expect an exact match with the predefined node types.
