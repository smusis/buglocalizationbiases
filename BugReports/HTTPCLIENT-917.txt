When authentication is invalidated during redirection, proxy authentication also should be invalidated



Description:
This was discovered during use by Lucene Connector Framework, on 3.1.

When a document is fetched through a proxy authenticated with NTLM, and
that document is a redirection (301 or 302), the httpclient fails to
properly use the right proxy credentials on the subsequent document
fetch. This leads to 407 errors on these kinds of documents.

I've attached a proposed patch.
