DisjunctionMaxQuery - Type safety  



Description:
DisjunctionMaxQuery code has containers that are not type-safe . The comments indicate type-safety though. 

Better to express in the API and the internals the explicit type as opposed to type-less containers. 

Patch attached. 

Comments / backward compatibility concerns welcome.
