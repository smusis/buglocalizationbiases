Do MultiTermQuery boolean rewrites per segment



Description:
MultiTermQuery currently rewrites FuzzyQuery (using TopTermsBooleanQueryRewrite), the auto constant rewrite method and the ScoringBQ rewrite methods using a MultiFields wrapper on the top-level reader. This is inefficient.

This patch changes the rewrite modes to do the rewrites per segment and uses some additional datastructures (hashed sets/maps) to exclude duplicate terms. All tests currently pass, but FuzzyQuery's tests should not, because it depends for the minimum score handling, that the terms are collected in order..

Robert will fix FuzzyQuery in this issue, too. This patch is just a start.
