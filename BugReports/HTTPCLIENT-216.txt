Cookies with null path attribute are rejected in the compatibility mode



Description:
Weblogic sends cookies with path empty, httpclient emits a warning
and doesn't send back the cookie to server.

Maybe httpclient works in the RFC's ways but this doesn't reproduce
common web browsers behaviours. Our application works well with IE,
Opera and Netscape, httpunit also sends back the cookie to the server.

When receving the response, httpclient emits the followin warning :

[WARN] HttpMethod - -Invalid cookie header: "JTD=O%

Path=; Max-Age=604800". Missing value for path attribute

That's right, maybe the http header is not correct, but I think httpclient
should handle this case without error in order to have the same behaviour
as common browsers. We have no way to give a better value to this path.
