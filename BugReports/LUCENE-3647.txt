DocValues merging is not associative, leading to different results depending upon how merges execute



Description:
recently I cranked up TestDuelingCodecs to actually test docvalues (previously it wasn't testing it at all).

This test is simple, it indexes the same random content with 2 different indexwriters, it just allows them
to use different codecs with different indexwriterconfigs.

then it asserts the indexes are equal.

Sometimes, always on BYTES_FIXED_DEREF type, we end out with one reader that has a zero-filled byte[] for a doc,
but that same document in the other reader has no docvalues at all.
