DatabaseFileSystem's logger references the wrong class



Description:
In DatabaseFileSystem, the logger is constructed as
private static Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DbFileSystem.class);

It should be constructed as:
private static Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(DatabaseFileSystem.class);
