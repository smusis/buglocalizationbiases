NodeTypeDefDiff.PropDefDiff.init() constraints change check bugs



Description:
Two bugs have been found in NodeTypeDefDiff.PropDefDiff.init() when try to modify property constraints of an already registered node type:

1) according to the java doc it should be possible to remove all constraints from a property, but it is not (marked as a MAJOR change).
 
2) it's allowed (TRIVIAL) to set a constraint to a property that had no constraint at all before, which is wrong, because it could affect the consistency of existing repository content.
