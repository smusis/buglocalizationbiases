Refactor FieldCacheRangeFilter.FieldCacheDocIdSet to be separate class and fix the dangerous matchDoc() throws AIOOBE requirement



Description:
Followup from LUCENE-3593:
The FieldCacheRangeFilter.FieldCacheDocIdSet class has a strange requirement on the abstract matchDoc(): It should throw AIOOBE if the docId is > maxDoc. This check should be done by caller as especially on trunk, e.g. FieldCacheTermsFilter does not seem to always throw this exception correctly (getOrd() is a method and no array in TermsIndex cache).

Also in 3.x the Filter does not correctly respect deletions when a FieldCache based on a reopened reader is used.

This issue will refactor this and fix the bugs and moves the docId check up to the iterator.
