optimize spanfirstquery, spanpositionrangequery



Description:
SpanFirstQuery and SpanPositionRangeQuery (SpanFirst is just a special case of this), are currently inefficient.

Take this worst case example: SpanFirstQuery("the").
Currently the code reads all the positions for the term "the".

But when enumerating spans, once we have passed the allowable range we should move on to the next document (skipTo)
