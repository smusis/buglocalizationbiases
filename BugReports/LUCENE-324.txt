org.apache.lucene.analysis.cn.ChineseTokenizer missing offset decrement



Description:
Apparently, in ChineseTokenizer, offset should be decremented like bufferIndex
when Character is OTHER_LETTER.  This directly affects startOffset and endOffset
values.

This is critical to have Highlighter working correctly because Highlighter marks
matching text based on these offset values.
