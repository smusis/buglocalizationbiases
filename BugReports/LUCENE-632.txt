The creation of a spell index from a LuceneDictionary via SpellChecker.indexDictionary (Dictionary dict) fails starting with 1.9.1 (up to current svn version)



Description:
Two different errors in 1.9.1/2.0.0 and current svn version.

1.9.1/2.0.0:
at the end of indexDictionary (Dictionary dict) 
the IndexReader-instance reader is closed.
This causes a NullpointerException because reader has not been initialized before (neither in that method nor in the constructor).
Uncommenting this line (reader.close()) seems to resolve that issue.

current svn:
the constructor tries to create an IndexSearcher-instance for the specified path;
as there is no index in that path - it is not created yet -  an exception is thrown.
