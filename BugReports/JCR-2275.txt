some legal jcr names cause unneccessary server-roundtrips 



Description:
assume the following legal qualified jcr names:

"{foo}"
"{foo} bar"

when items with such names are read from the spi layer, they are first interpreted as expanded form names.
a prefix lookup for namespace 'foo' fails and the name is treated as qualified jcr name.

=> depending on the spi implementation, a server-roundtrip is required in order to determine that 'foo' is not a
registered namespace.
