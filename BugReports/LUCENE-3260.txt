need a test that uses termsenum.seekExact() (which returns true), then calls next()



Description:
i tried to do some seekExact (where the result must exist) then next()ing in the faceting module,
and it seems like there could be a bug here.

I think we should add a test that mixes seekExact/seekCeil/next like this, to ensure that
if seekExact returns true, that the enum is properly positioned.
