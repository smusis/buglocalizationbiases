Checking of stale connections is broken



Description:
HttpConnections that went stale (dropped by server) throw SocketExceptions
instead of silently re-opening themselves, as has been the case with earlier
versions of HttpClient.

I think the problem for this can be found in HttpConnection:

  public boolean closeIfStale() throws IOException {
    if (used && isOpen && isStale()) {
      LOG.debug("Connection is stale, closing...");
      close();
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

staleness is only checked if used = true, but there is no code in HttpConnection
that sets the used flag. In other words: used is always false and isStale() is
never called.
