Use of google-code-prettify for Lucene/Solr Javadoc



Description:
My company, RONDHUIT uses google-code-prettify (Apache License 2.0) in Javadoc for syntax highlighting:

I think we can use it for Lucene javadoc (java sample code in overview.html etc) and Solr javadoc (Analyzer Factories etc) to improve or simplify our life.
