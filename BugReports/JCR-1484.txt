Node.getReferences() does not properly reflect saved but not yet committed changes



Description:
Node.getReferences() currently only returns committed references. The specification however says:

<quote>
Some level 2 implementations may only return properties that have been
saved (in a transactional setting this includes both those properties
that have been saved but not yet committed, as well as properties that
have been committed). Other level 2 implementations may additionally
return properties that have been added within the current Session but are
not yet saved.

Jackrabbit does not support the latter, but at least has to support the first.
