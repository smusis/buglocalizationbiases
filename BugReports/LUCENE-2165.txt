SnowballAnalyzer lacks a constructor that takes a Set of Stop Words



Description:
As discussed on the java-user list, the SnowballAnalyzer has been updated to use a Set of stop words. However, there is no constructor which accepts a Set, there's only the original String[] one

This is an issue, because most of the common sources of stop words (eg StopAnalyzer) have deprecated their String[] stop word lists, and moved over to Sets (eg StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET). So, for now, you either have to use a deprecated field on StopAnalyzer, or manually turn the Set into an array so you can pass it to the SnowballAnalyzer

I would suggest that a constructor is added to SnowballAnalyzer which accepts a Set. Not sure if the old String[] one should be deprecated or not.

A sample patch against 2.9.1 to add the constructor is:
