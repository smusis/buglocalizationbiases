TCK: Test that expect that modifications made by Session1 are automatically visible to Session2



Description:
While changes made by session1 are automatically visible to any other session2 with the RI, this is not required by the
specification. Therefore i would suggest to modify the following test cases:

- NodeUUIDTest.testSaveMovedRefNode()
- SessionUUIDTest.testSaveMovedRefNode()

-> no patch. sorry.

- NodeTest.testRemoveInvalidItemStateException()

-> see patch.
