SegmentInfo.sizeInBytes ignore includeDocStore when caching



Description:
I noticed that SegmentInfo's sizeInBytes cache is potentially buggy -- it doesn't take into account 'includeDocStores'. I.e., if you call it once w/ 'false' (sizeInBytes won't include the store files) and then with 'true' (or vice versa), you won't get the right sizeInBytes (it won't re-compute, with the store files).

I'll fix and add a test case demonstrating the bug.
