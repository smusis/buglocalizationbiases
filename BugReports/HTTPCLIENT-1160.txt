LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket() should have access to HttpParams



Description:
We use a custom implementation of LayeredSchemeSocketFactory that manages a keystore location through HttpParams. That allows us to use different keystores on a per connection basis.

When a proxy is used LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket() is invoked which does not have a parameter that passes the HttpParams along. In consequence certificate authentication fails in our implementation. Is there a reason why all other factory methods in the super class have an HttpParams parameter except for LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket()?

The downstream bug is here:

369805: certificate authentication with custom keystore fails behind proxy

Any input would be greatly appreciated.
