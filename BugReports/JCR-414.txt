jcr:successors property not persisted correctly within a transaction



Description:
During a transaction, if you create a new version then read the version history the "jcr:successors" property is not updated. Note that "jcr:predecessors" is updated properly.

Also, the version history is sometimes not propertly read. During the transaction, it might appear empty. This behavior in not consistent from one execution to another.

After a restart of the repository, the version history and the "jcr:successors" property is read properly.

* Tests cases will follow shortly.

Thanks,
