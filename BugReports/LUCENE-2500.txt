A Linux-specific Directory impl that bypasses the buffer cache



Description:
I've been testing how we could prevent Lucene's merges from evicting
pages from the OS's buffer cache.  I tried fadvise/madvise (via JNI)
but (frustratingly), I could not get them to work (details at
http://chbits.blogspot.com/2010/06/lucene-and-fadvisemadvise.html).

The only thing that worked was to use Linux's O_DIRECT flag, which
forces all IO to bypass the buffer cache entirely... so I created a
Linux-specific Directory impl to do this.
