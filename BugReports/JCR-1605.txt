RepositoryLock does not work on NFS sometimes



Description:
The RepositoryLock mechanism currently used in Jackrabbit uses FileLock. This doesn't work on some NFS file system. It looks like only NFS version 4 and newer supports locking. Older implementations may throw a IOException "No locks available", which means the NFS does not support byte-range locking.

I propose to add a second locking mechanism, and add a configuration option to use it. For example: <FileLocking class="acme" />. This second locking mechanism is a cooperative locking protocol that uses a background (watchdog) thread and only uses regular file operations.
