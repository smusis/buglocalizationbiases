Documentation bug.  The 2.4.1 query parser syntax wiki page says it is for 1.9



Description:
This page:

http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_4_1/queryparsersyntax.html

says this:
.bq
This page provides the Query Parser syntax in Lucene 1.9. If you are using a different version of Lucene, please consult the copy of docs/queryparsersyntax.html that was distributed with the version you are using. 

This is misleading on a doc page for 2.4.1
