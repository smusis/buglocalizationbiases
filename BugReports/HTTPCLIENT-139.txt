You are basically right hands down. It does make sense for the HTTP version 
flag to have HttpClient scope. We should address this shortcoming as a part of 
the post-2.0-release redesign

Feel free to file a bug report to make sure the issue does not go forgotten

Many thanks for bring it up

Cheers

Oleg

The boolean variable http11 is set on a method by method basis. For PutMethod, 
decisions (eg. Expect: 100-continue request header) are made prior to 
determining the value for Http11 (chicken and egg problem) and so the default 
(true) is used to produce the request. An HTTP/1.0 server hangs waiting for 
the extra data on the PUT method body. 

For applications that are using HttpClient (ie. they do not manipulate the 
HTTP methods directly and cannot be expected to set the value of Http11 for 
each method instance), shouldn't http11 have HttpClient scope ? This would 
allow an interaction (eg. OPTIONS) to set http11 and all methods thereafter 
would use this setting?
