JCR2SPI: Workspace.getImportHandler creates a handler which doesn't work properly under JDK 1.4.



Description:
JCR2SPI returns an import handler which delegates work to a SAXTransformerHandler. In JDK, that one has a known issue not processing namespace prefix mappings properly (will attach a separate test case).

Proposals:

- drop JDK 1.4 support
- tune the JCR2SPI handler to create namespace attributes when needed
- use an entirely different serializer

My personal preference would be just to drop JDK 1.4 support, but that may not be acceptable for everyone.
