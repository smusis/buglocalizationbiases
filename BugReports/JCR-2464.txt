Reduce usage of String.intern()



Description:
String.intern() is used for interning the namespace URI in NameImpl. For some trivial cases the intern() method shouldn't be called but a constant should be
used. E.g. I'm thinking about the empty namespace URI, where calling String.intern() is way more expensive than checking if the length of the URI string is zero.
