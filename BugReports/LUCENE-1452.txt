Binary field content lost during optimize



Description:
Scenario:

* create an index with arbitrary content, and close it
* open IndexWriter again, and add a document with binary field (stored but not compressed)
* close IndexWriter _without_ optimizing, so that the new document is in a separate segment.
* open IndexReader. You can read the last document and its binary field just fine.
* open IndexWriter, optimize the index, close IndexWriter
* open IndexReader. Now the field is still present (not null) and is marked as binary, but the data is not there - Field.getBinaryLength() returns 0.
