Path returned by FileSystemBLOBStore.createId() is not absolute



Description:
Hi,

I have developed my own FileSystem in which I call FileSystemPathUtil.checkFormat(path) for every operation on the file system.
When the file system is called to store a BLOB value, the path I get is always relative, resulting in a "not an absolute path" FileSystemException.

The problem has been traced back to org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.util.FileSystemBLOBStore.creatId().
I think there should be a:
   sb.append(FileSystem.SEPARATOR_CHAR);
before the for loop.

Thanks.
