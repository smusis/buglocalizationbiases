GCJ build fails with JDK 1.5



Description:
The build.xml doesn't specify a target VM version. Using JDK 1.5, this means the compiled .class files 
are automatically made for 1.5, with java.lang.StringBuilder insidiously used for string concatenation. 
GCJ doesn't seem to include this class yet, so when it gets to the gcj build it dies trying to read the class 
files.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Install Sun JDK 1.5 for a Java compiler
2. Check out Lucene from svn
3. 'ant gcj'

Expected behavior:
Should build Lucene to .class files and .jar with the JDK compiler and then compile an .a with GCJ.

Actual behavior:
The GCJ build fails, complaining of being unable to find java.lang.StringBuilder.

Suggested fix:
Adding source="1.3" target="1.3" to the <javac> tasks seems to take care of this. Patch to be attached.

Additional notes:
Using Lucene from SVN and GCJ pulled from GCC CVS circa 2005-04-19. Ant 1.6.2.
