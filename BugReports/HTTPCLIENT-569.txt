HttpState.clearCookies() should be synchronized



Description:
The HttpState class has a clearCookies method that is not synchronized but
should be considering it modifies an ArrayList (which is unsynchronized). All
other methods which modify or read from the ArrayList are synchronized except
the clearCookies method. 

I stumbled upon this fact because a webapp I am working on that uses HttpClient
threw an IllegalArgumentException indicating that one of the cookies in the
array returned from HttpState.getCookies() was null, which shouldn't be
possible.  Upon further inspection and testing, the only possible option is that
the threadsafety hole left by the unsynchronized clearCookies method caused the
issue.
