JCR-Server: Workspace.restore not mapped correctly



Description:
(issue reported by David Kennedy)

Workspace.restore(Version[], boolean) won't work, since versions are not retrieved correctly. The version history that can be access from the request  resource, cannot be used to retrieve the versions needed for a workspace.restore call.

possible short term fix:
From the version-hrefs present in the request body of the UPDATE request, version resources must be built and
the corresponding version item retrieved.

alternative:
find a proper mapping for Workspace.restore(Version[], boolean). having UPDATE on a resource representing a javax.jcr.Node being mapped to a workspace.restore is odd.
