Configurable actions upon authorizable creation and removal



Description:
i would like to add the possibility to configure custom actions that are executed upon user (and group) creation before 
the operation is persisted. this would allow applications to run custom code without the need of subclassing the
usermanager implementation. e.g.: creating additional mandatory properties, setting up permissions, calculating default 
group membership. the same applies for user/group removal.
