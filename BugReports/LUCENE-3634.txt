remove old static main methods in core



Description:
We have a few random static main methods that I think are very rarely used... we should remove them (IndexReader, UTF32ToUTF8, English).

The IndexReader main lets you list / extract the sub-files from a CFS... I think we should move this to a new tool in contrib/misc.
