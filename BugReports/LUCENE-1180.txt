Syns2Index fails



Description:
Running Syns2Index fails with a
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: maxBufferedDocs must at least be 2 when enabled exception.
at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.setMaxBufferedDocs(IndexWriter.java:883)
at org.apache.lucene.wordnet.Syns2Index.index(Syns2Index.java:249)
at org.apache.lucene.wordnet.Syns2Index.main(Syns2Index.java:208)

The code is here
		// blindly up these parameters for speed
		writer.setMergeFactor( writer.getMergeFactor() * 2);
		writer.setMaxBufferedDocs( writer.getMaxBufferedDocs() * 2);

It looks like getMaxBufferedDocs used to return 10, and now it returns -1, not sure when that started happening.

My suggestion would be to just remove these three lines.  Since speed has already improved vastly, there isn't a need to speed things up.

To run this, Syns2Index requires two args.  The first is the location of the wn_s.pl file, and the second is the directory to create the index in.
