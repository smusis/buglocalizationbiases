Move generic locking tests from jcr2spi to jackrabbit-jcr-tests



Description:
once we touch the jackrabbit-jcr-tests for the JSR 283 implementation, we should also move the generic tests from jackrabbit-jcr2spi to the overall test suite.

opening this issue as a reminder and as a marker issue.
