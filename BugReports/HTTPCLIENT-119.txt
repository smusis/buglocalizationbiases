[PATCH] FilePart fails to send data on second call to send



Description:
When using a FilePart with the MultipartPostMethod and a server that requires 
authentication, the first call to FilePart.send() sends the data correctly and 
HttpClient receives an unauthorized response from the server.  If HttpClient is 
set to automatically handle authentication attempts it then attempts to send 
the FilePart again at which time the InputStream FilePart reads from is empty 
so it doesn't send any data.

Due to this, the data actually sent by HttpClient doesn't match the content 
length specified so the server continues to wait for the data and doesn't 
respond, leaving HttpClient to timeout while waiting for a response.

This occurs with the latest source from CVS as of 16 October 2002.
