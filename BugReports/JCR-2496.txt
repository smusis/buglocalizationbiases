Internal error in WorkspaceItemStateFactory#createDeepNodeState 



Description:
When WorkspaceItemStateFactory#createDeepNodeState receives the current entry as argument for anyParent, it throws RepositoryException with the message "Internal error while getting deep itemState". This is incorrect (probably a leftover from JCR-1797) since any entry is valid as argument for anyParent.
