common interface for HttpRoute and RouteTracker



Description:
Classes HttpRoute and RouteTracker have many identical getters. There should be a common interface, for example RouteInfo, to define these getters and a toRoute() method that returns an unmodifiable representation. Some portions of the API may then accept the interface instead of the specific class HttpRoute.
