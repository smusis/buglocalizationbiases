Default configuration not suitable for demo web application



Description:
The default configuration is not suitable for the demo application. There are no text extractors configured, which makes the populate and search demos useless.

Proposed solution: create a new repository.xml in jackrabbit-webapp with text extractors configured.

I know we should actually try to reduce the number of repository.xml files, but having one dedicated to jackrabbit-webapp seems reasonable, while we should try to achieve the same for the jackrabbit-core module.
