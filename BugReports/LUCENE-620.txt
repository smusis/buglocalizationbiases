GData Server - TestCase Deadlock  StorageModifier



Description:
Solfed the racecondition deadlock while closing the StorageController.
This occured the first time hossman tried to run the test cases. 

Concurrent Modification Exception while iteration over a collection in a sepereate thread -- ModifiedEntryFilter replaced list with array.

@Hossman if you can get to it, could you try the testcases again.

@all If you guys do have time you could run the testcases on different environment, that would help to resolve bugs in the test cases and the server.
