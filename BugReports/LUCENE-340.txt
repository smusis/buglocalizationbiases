[PATCH] Highlighter: Delegate output escaping to Formatter



Description:
Patch for jakarta-lucene-sandbox/contributions/highlighter
CVS version 3rd February 2005

This patch allows the highlighter Formatter to control escaping of the non
highlighted text as well as the highlighting of the matching text.

The example formatters highlight the matching text using XML/HTML tags. This
works fine if the plain text does not contain any characters that need to be
escaped for HTML output (i.e. <, &, and "), however this cannot be guaranteed.
As the formatter controls the method of highlighting (in the examples this is
HTML, but it could be any other form of markup) it should also be responsible
for escaping the rest of the output.

This patch adds a method, encodeText(String), to the Formatter interface. This
is a breaking change. This method is called from the Highlighter with the text
that is not passed to the formatter's highlightTerm method. 
The SimpleHTMLFormatter has a public static method for performing simple HTML
escaping called htmlEncode. 
The SimpleHTMLFormatter, GradientFormatter, and SpanGradientFormatter have been
updated to implement the encodeText method and call the htmlEncode method to
escape the output.

For existing formatter to maintain exactly the same behaviour as before applying
this patch they would need to implement the encodeText method to return the
argument value without modification, e.g.:

public String encodeText(String originalText)
{
  return originalText;
}
