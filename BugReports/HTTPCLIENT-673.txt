revise max-per-host configuration



Description:
Max-per-host settings for ThreadSafeClientConnManagers are currently stored in HttpParams, where the parameter value is a map from HttpRoute (formerly HostConfiguration) to Integer. This has several drawbacks:

1) maintaining a map as a value in HttpParams doesn't match my understanding of how params should be used
2) the maximums based on HttpRoute are really specific to the TSCCM implementation and not a generic parameterization

some of the options are:

a) revise to define a more generic parameterization approach
b) revise into an implementation specific parameterization approach
c) define an implementation (TSCCM) specific configuration interface and a default implementation keeping the map as run-time data

cheers,
