move preflexrw to lucene3x package



Description:
Currently there are a lot of things made public in lucene3x codec, but all marked internal/experimental/deprecated.

A lot of this is just so our test codec (preflexrw) can subclass it. I think we should just move it to the same
package, then it call all be package-private.
