Unclosed threads in Jackrabbit



Description:
The Tomcat integration test added in JCR-2831 shows the following warnings about Jackrabbit threads that remain in place even after the repository has been closed:

08-Dec-2010 12:14:58 org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader clearReferencesThreads
SEVERE: The web application [] appears to have started a thread named [Timer-1] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.
08-Dec-2010 12:14:58 org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader clearReferencesThreads
SEVERE: The web application [] appears to have started a thread named [DynamicPooledExecutor] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.
08-Dec-2010 12:14:58 org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader clearReferencesThreads
SEVERE: The web application [] appears to have started a thread named [Timer-2] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.

It would be best to close all such background threads even if they are singleton daemon threads and thus unlikely to cause trouble when left unattended.
