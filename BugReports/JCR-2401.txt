OSGi bundle symbolic names changed due to changes in maven-bundle-plugin



Description:
See FELIX-1886 - I have noticed this with jackrabbit-jcr-commons 2.0-beta3 but I assume all modules which use maven-bundle-plugin are affected.

Having bundle symbolic name changes is problematic as OSGi frameworks then consider the old a new bundles to be different components, instead of different versions of the same component.

The simplest way to go back to the previous symbolic names is probably to use the maven-bundle-plugin config workaround described in FELIX-1886, in the jackrabbit parent pom (or whever that plugin is configured).

I'll try that and supply a patch.
