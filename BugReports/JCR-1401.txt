Removing-nodes with unexpected nodetype



Description:
tobias adds a logic with JCR-973 that the DefaultHandler checks the nodetype of the jcr:content node
and if it does not match it will be deleted and created with the new one.
i think its dangerous to automacially change a node type.
if the node was added programatically and then saved through webdav it could happen that the nodetype will be changed
from nt:resource to the nt:unstructured.
if some logic depends on the nodetype the failure search will be hard ;-)
