fix assertions/checks that use File.length() to use getFilePointer()



Description:
This came up on this thread "Getting RuntimeException: after flush: fdx size mismatch while Indexing" 
(http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/a8db01a220f0a126)

In trunk, a side effect of the codec refactoring is that these assertions were pushed into codecs as finish() before close().
they check getFilePointer() instead in this computation, which checks that lucene did its part (instead of falsely tripping if directory metadata is stale).

I think we should fix these checks/asserts on 3.x too
