random localization test failures



Description:
Some tests fail randomly (hard to reproduce). It appears to me that this is caused by uninitialized date fields. For example Uwe reported a failure today in this test of TestQueryParser:

{code}
 /** for testing legacy DateField support */
  public void testLegacyDateRange() throws Exception {
    String startDate = getLocalizedDate(2002, 1, 1, false);
    String endDate = getLocalizedDate(2002, 1, 4, false);
{code}

if you look at the helper getLocalizedDate, you can see if the 4th argument is false, it does not initialize all date field functions.
{code}
  private String getLocalizedDate(int year, int month, int day, boolean extendLastDate) {
 Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();
 calendar.set(year, month, day);
 if (extendLastDate) {
      calendar.set(Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, 23);
      calendar.set(Calendar.MINUTE, 59);
      calendar.set(Calendar.SECOND, 59);
 ...
}
{code}

I think the solution to this is that in all tests, whereever we create new GregorianCalendar(), it should be followed by a call to Calendar.clear().
This will ensure that we always initialize unused calendar fields to zero, rather than being dependent on the local time.
