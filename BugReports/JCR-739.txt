String literal must not interpret entity references



Description:
The ampersand character in a string literal is interpreted as a start character for an entity reference. This is because Jackrabbit uses an XQuery parser where a string literal is slightly more constraint than in XPath.

Example:

//element(*, nt:base)[jcr:contains(., 'max&moritz')]

throws a parse exception. Instead the parser should simply recognize the ampersand as regular character.
