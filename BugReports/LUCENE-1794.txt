implement reusableTokenStream for all contrib analyzers



Description:
most contrib analyzers do not have an impl for reusableTokenStream

regardless of how expensive the back compat reflection is for indexing speed, I think we should do this to mitigate any performance costs. hey, overall it might even be an improvement!

the back compat code for non-final analyzers is already in place so this is easy money in my opinion.
