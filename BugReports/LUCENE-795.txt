deprecate Directory.renameFile()



Description:
Copied from my mailing list post so this issue can be tracked (if necessary). I will commit a patch.

I see that Directory.renameFile() isn't used anymore. I assume it has only 
been public for technical reasons, not because we expect this to be used 
from outside of Lucene? Should we deprecate this method? Its 
implementation e.g. in FSDirectory looks a bit scary anyway (the comment 
correctly says "This is not atomic" while the abstract class says "This 
replacement should be atomic").
