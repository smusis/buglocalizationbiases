Lock test assumes that changes in one session are immediately visible in different session



Description:
LockTest.testLogout() assumes that a change in one session (logging out, removing a session-scoped lock) is immediately visible in another session.

Proposal: insert a 

 n1.getSession().refresh(true);

call before checking

 assertFalse("node must not be locked", n1.isLocked());
