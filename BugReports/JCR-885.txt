BundlePersistenceManager.externalBLOBs can not be configured



Description:
If you try to configure the property externalBLOBs through the workspace.xml it does not work.
The BundlePersistenceManager has not Method setExternalBLOBs(boolean externalBLOBs) so it can not be configured
because its not bean conform. See the DatabasePersistenceManager which has such a Method
