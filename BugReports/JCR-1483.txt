Move common node type functionality to jackrabbit-spi-commons



Description:
now, that jackrabbit-core has a dependency to jackrabbit-spi-commons it would be possible to have the common functionality shared by core and jcr2spi in the spi-commons project.

the node type package offers quite some potential for that.
