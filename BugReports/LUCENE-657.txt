FuzzyQuery should not be final



Description:
I am trying to extend the FuzzyQuery to further filter the TermEnum. (I am indexing stem forms and original forms, but I only want to match original forms with a fuzzy term, otherwise I get to much noise). However, FuzzyQuery is a final class and I cannot extend it.  

As discussed in the mailing list (http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/38756), we want to make the private variables and inner classes protected.

I am attaching a patch for FuzzyQuery.java that implements this. I ran all unit tests and they passed without errors.

Andreas.
