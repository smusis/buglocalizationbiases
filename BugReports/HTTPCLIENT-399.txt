Connection not closed after "Connection: close" request



Description:
In HTTP specification at http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-
sec8.html , under chapter "Negotiation", it is stated :
"If either the client or the server sends the close token in the Connection 
header, that request becomes the last one for the connection."

HttpClient (v2.0.2 and v3.0 alpha2) is currently closing connection only if 
server has sent "Connection: close" header, and not when request contains it.
