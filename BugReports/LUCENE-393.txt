Inconsistent scoring with SpanTermQuery in BooleanQuery



Description:
When a SpanTermQuery is added to a BooleanQuery, incorrect results are 
returned.

I am running Lucene 1.9 RC1 on Windows XP.  I have a test case which has 
several tests.  It has an index with 4 identical documents in it.

When two TermQuerys are used in a BooleanQuery, the score looks like this:
  4 hits for search: two term queries
    ID:1 (score:0.54932046)
    ID:2 (score:0.54932046)
    ID:3 (score:0.54932046)
    ID:4 (score:0.54932046)

Notice how it is correctly setting the score to be the same for each document.

When two SpanQuerys are used in a BooleanQuery, the score looks like this:
  2 hits for search: two span queries
    ID:1 (score:0.3884282)
    ID:4 (score:0.1942141)

Notice how it only returned two documents instead of four.  And the two it did 
return have differing scores.

I believe that there is an error in the scoring algorithm that is making the 
other two documents not show up.
