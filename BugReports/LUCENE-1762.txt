Slightly more readable code in Token/TermAttributeImpl



Description:
No big deal. 

growTermBuffer(int newSize) was using correct, but slightly hard to follow code. 

the method was returning null as a hint that the current termBuffer has enough space to the upstream code or reallocated buffer.

this patch simplifies logic   making this method to only reallocate buffer, nothing more.  
It reduces number of if(null) checks in a few methods and reduces amount of code. 
all tests pass.

This also adds tests for the new basic attribute impls (copies of the Token tests).
