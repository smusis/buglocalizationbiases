Buffered output to socket

Hi all,

This is probably a known issue (but I haven't found the answer for it yet).
I'm using httpclient to post data to a remote server but as far as I can see
(using ethereal) the client is writing every line to the wire without buffering.
After examining the code, I can see that the HttpConnection class is using the
output stream received from the socket directly.
Is there a reason for the direct writing?
This is a problem for me 'cause the remote server sets a very low timeout and
returns a bad request response after receiving the request line (without any
other header line or request body).

Can I easily add a buffered behavior to the http client?
