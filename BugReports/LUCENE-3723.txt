Remove FieldMaskingSpanQuery (or fix its scoring)



Description:
In Lucene 4.0 we added new scoring mechanisms, but FieldMaskingSpanQuery is a serious problem:

Because it lies about the fields of its terms, this sometimes results in totally bogus
statistics, cases where a single terms totalTermFreq exceeds sumTotalTermFreq for the entire field (since its lying about it).

Such lying could result in NaN/Inf/Negative scores, exceptions, divide by zero, and other problems,
because the statistics are impossibly bogus.
