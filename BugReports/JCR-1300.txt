spi2dav Improve performance for large binary properties



Description:
Sending large binary properties over spi2dav is slow and requires a lot of heap space in both client and server.
One problematic part is base64 conversion of the property value.

On the contrary, using 'normal' webdav interface (/repository/default/ instead of /server) for uploading a file (through traditional webdav client) it is pretty fast and don't have such impact on heap space.

Some suggestions from the previous discussion:
 - avoid temporary copies of the data, and persist large objects as early as possible. 
 - transfer large objects in blocks from the Jackrabbit SPI client to the server (and back).
 - make usage of the global data store (JCR-926). 
 - straight forward PUT for single-valued properties
