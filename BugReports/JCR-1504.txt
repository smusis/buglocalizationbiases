MS Excel Mime Type missing in MsExcelTextExtractor 



Description:
The MsExcelTextExtractor listens to mime type "application/vnd.ms-excel", but storing excels will result in mime type "application/msexcel", too. Such tagged files will not be indexed by the MsExcelTextExtractor. The class should register itself to both mime types like the MsWordTextExtractor does.
