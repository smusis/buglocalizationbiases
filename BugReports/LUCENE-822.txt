Make FieldSelector usable from Searchable 



Description:
Seems reasonable that you would want to be able to specify a FieldSelector from Searchable because many systems do not use IndexSearcher (where you can get a Reader), but instead use Searchable or Searcher so that Searchers and MultiSearchers can be used in a polymorphic manner.
