Rate-limit IO used by merging



Description:
Large merges can mess up searches and increase NRT reopen time (see
http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/06/lucenes-near-real-time-search-is-fast.html).

A simple rate limiter improves the spikey NRT reopen times during big
merges, so I think we should somehow make this possible.  Likely this
would reduce impact on searches as well.

Typically apps that do indexing and searching on same box are in no
rush to see the merges complete so this is a good tradeoff.
