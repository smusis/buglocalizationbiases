Parallelize tests



Description:
As mentioned on the mailing list I'd like to parallelize test execution.

There will be a pool of RepositoryHelper instances, each represents a distinct repository. This ensures that test cases that run in parallel do not interfere with each other. I suggest we start with a pool of two repositories, but we can later extend this setup.
