jcr-server: DefaultItemCollection#unlock does not call DavSession#removeReference



Description:
DefaultItemCollection#unlock does not remove the token-reference from the DavSession that has been added
before upon creating the lock. This causes pending lock-references thus the cache entries in JCRWebdavServer
will not be cleared filling up the cache although the locks have been properly released.
