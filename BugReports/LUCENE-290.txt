[PATCH] public static members in class TermVectorsWriter



Description:
hi all,

looking at the implementation of TermVectorsWriter, you'll find a bunch of
public static final members where the visibility could be reduced to be
protected. I don't see a reason for having them public if the class itself is
protected and all members are final values. May be somebody could check and
either commit or enlighten me ;-)

thx
Bernhard
