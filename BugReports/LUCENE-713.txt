File Formats Documentation is not correct for Term Vectors



Description:
From Samir Abdou on the dev mailing list:

Hi, 

There is an inconsistency between the files format page (from Lucene
website) and the source code. It concerns the positions and offsets of term
vectors. It seems that documentation (website) is not up to date. According
to the file format page, offsets and positions are not stored! Is that
correct?

Many thanks,

Samir

Indeed, in the file formats term vectors section it doesn't talk about the storing of position and offset info.
