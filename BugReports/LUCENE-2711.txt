BooleanScorer.nextDoc should also delegate to sub-scorer's bulk scoring method



Description:
BooleanScorer uses the bulk score methods of its sub scorers, asking them to score each chunk of 2048 docs.

However, its .nextDoc fails to do this, instead manually walking through the sub's docs (calling .nextDoc()), which is slower (though this'd be tiny in practice).

As far as I can tell it should delegate to the bulk scorer just like it does in its bulk scorer method.
