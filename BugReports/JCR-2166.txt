Provide query support  for WEAKREFERENCE reverse lookup



Description:
the current implementation of Node.getWeakReferences() and getWeakReferences(String) uses a fulltext query in order to find weak references to a particular node.

this requires the PlainTextExtractor to be enabled in the Search config, e.g. :

    <param name="textFilterClasses" value="org.apache.jackrabbit.extractor.PlainTextExtractor"/>

providing 'native' WEAKREFERNCE reverse lookup in Jackrabbit's QOM implementation would be certainly more efficient.
