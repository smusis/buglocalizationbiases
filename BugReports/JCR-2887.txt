Split PrivilegeRegistry in a per-session manager instance and a repository level registry



Description:
in order to resolve the privilegeregistry related TODOs within jackrabbit-core, i would like to split off those 
methods from PrivilegeRegistry  that are used on a per-session level (including jcr-names) and add them
to a manager class that was present with each session context. consequently the responsibility of the
registry was then limited to read/build the privilege definitions and would be present on the repositorycontext
deprecating those methods that would be covered by the manager).
in addition the naming was then consistent with what we use to have for nodetypes and namespaces.
