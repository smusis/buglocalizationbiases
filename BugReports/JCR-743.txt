XA Transaction Recovery



Description:
If i add a node to the repository i get a XAException because i run into a Timeout ... 
I see the Warn Message: Transaction rolled back because timeout expired.
The default Timeout is set to 5 sec and i dont know how to set it to a higher value
The Problem is if i restart my server websphere has a RecoveryManager and he try to recover this Transaction
and then i get a NullpointerException in JCAManagedConnectionFactory. createManagedConnection beacuse the given 
ConnectionRequestInfo is null.
So i dont know why the RecoveryManager tries to recover the Transaction ? The only solution for me is to delete the Tran-Log Files wich keep Websphere to recvoer
XA Trasnactions.
