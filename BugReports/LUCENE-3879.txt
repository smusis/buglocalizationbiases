fix more position corrumptions in 4.0 codecs



Description:
Spinoff of LUCENE-3876.

Some codecs have invalid asserts, wrong shift operators etc.

If a position exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE/2 and then also has a payload,
it will produce corrumpt indexes or other strange errors.

Easiest way to trigger the bugs is to sometimes add a payload to the test from LUCENE-3876.
