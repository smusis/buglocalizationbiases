Cluster sync not always done when calling session.refresh(..)



Description:
Session.refresh(..) is supposed to synchronize cluster changes, but this doesn't always happen, specially if the syncDelay is low. The reason is a wrong assumption in ClusterNode.sync: The code there to avoid duplicate sync calls doesn't always work as expected. The following algorithm is used:

        int count = syncCount;
        syncLock.acquire();
        if (count == syncCount) {
            journalSync();
            syncCount++;
        }
        syncLock.release();

The problem is that the background thread might be at the line "syncCount++" when Session.refresh(..) is called, so that the main thread believes journalSync was already called and thus doesn't call it.
