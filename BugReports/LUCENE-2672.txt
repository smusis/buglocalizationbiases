speed up automaton seeking in nextString



Description:
While testing, i found there are some queries (e.g. wildcard ?????????) that do quite a lot of backtracking.

nextString doesn't handle this particularly well, when it walks the DFA, if it hits a dead-end and needs to backtrack, it increments the bytes, and starts over completely.

alternatively it could save the path information in an int[], and backtrack() could return a position to restart from, instead of just a boolean.
