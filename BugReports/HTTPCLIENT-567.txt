EasyX509TrustManager no longer checks cert expiry



Description:
EasyX509TrustManager was made even "easier" by the last commit:  a socket will
now be created when talking to a server with an expired certificate.

2 commits ago it looked like this (notice "return false" on line 107):

102             try {
103                 certificate.checkValidity();
104             }
105             catch (CertificateException e) {
106                 LOG.error(e.toString());
107                 return false;
108             }


Now it looks like this:

102             try {
103                 certificate.checkValidity();
104             }
105             catch (CertificateException e) {
106                 LOG.error(e.toString());
107             }


I'm proposing we just do:

102             certificate.checkValidity();

Now that we're using Java 1.4 in the contrib code, we'll just let the
CertificateException fly up the stack.
