New Jackrabbit site skin



Description:
Some time ago Michael Eppelheimer from Day created a new skin for the Jackrabbit web site, and I've now streamlined it a bit and integrated it with the Maven site build mechanism.

The templates should be easy to adapt also for Confluence when we get around to that migration.
