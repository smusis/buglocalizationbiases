multitermquery scoring differences between 3x and trunk



Description:
try this patch with a test, that applies clean to both 3x and trunk, but fails on trunk.

if you modify the test-data-generator to use TopTerms*BoostOnly* rewrite, then it acts like TestFuzzyQuery2, and passes.

So the problem is in TopTermsScoringBooleanRewrite, or BooleanQuery, or somewhere else.
