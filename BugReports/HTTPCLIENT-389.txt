Provide Date Header Util Methods



Description:
Hello,

It would be really nice to have util methods that help with setting date
headers.  For instance, like the servlet spec's setDateHeader() method.  This
allows for the client of HttpClient to not have to deal with formatting the date
into the correct string.  There is a parseDate method that turns a String into a
Date.  It would be nice to have the opposite method.

Thanks!
Seth
