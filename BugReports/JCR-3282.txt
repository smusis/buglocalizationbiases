Optimize usage of norms



Description:
There is a very significant potential for optimizing the size of the search index.

We have seen a case where there were multiple segments with about the same number of nodes (roughly 10 million), but the size on disk was very different.
One segment was 19 GB while all others where around 3 GB. The major difference was the number of fields indexed. The large segment had significantly more fields, which resulted in a large norms file.

We should go through our implementation and see where norms are really necessary and disable tracking of norms wherever possible.
