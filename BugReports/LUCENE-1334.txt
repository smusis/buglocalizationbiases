Term improvement



Description:
Term is designed for reuse of the supplied filter, to minimize intern().

One of the common use patterns is to create a Term with the txt field being an empty string.

To simplify this pattern and to document it's usefulness, I suggest adding a constructor:
public Term(String fld)
with the obvious implementation
and use it throughout core and contrib as a replacement.
