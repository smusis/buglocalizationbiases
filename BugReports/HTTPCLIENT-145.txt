Align the code base with checkstyle



Description:
The style use in HttpClient is still quite inconsistant.  checkstyle should be
used to align the code base to a similar style.

The checkstyle report can be found at:
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/checkstyle-report.html

And can be generated with:
maven checkstyle:generate-report
