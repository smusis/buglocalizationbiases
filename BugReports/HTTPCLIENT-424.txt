setAuthPreemptive restricted to BASIC AuthScheme



Description:
Pre-emptive authentication is hardcoded to be restricted to the BASIC
authentication scheme.  To fully support custom authentication schemes,
pre-emptive authentication should be made configurable, either globally, or on a
per-scheme basis.  A potential compromise may be to require AuthSchemes to
report whether they support pre-emptive capability if we wish to explicitly
exclude certain schemes from pre-emptive authentication.
