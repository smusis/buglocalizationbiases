Lazy Field Loading has edge case bug causing read past EOF



Description:
While trying to run some benchmarking of Lazy filed loading, i discovered there seems to be an edge case when accessing the last field of the last doc of an index.

the problem seems to only happen when the doc has been accessed after at least one other doc.

i have not tried to dig into the code to find the root cause, testcase to follow...
