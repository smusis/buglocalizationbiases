jcr2spi: transient removal of mandatory item throws ConstraintViolationException



Description:
reported by tobi:

the transient removal of a mandatory (non-protected) item immediately fails. 
instead the check should be postponed until the save() call, since it would be perfectly legal to remove the mandatory item and then re-add it.

suggested fix:
ItemStateValidator#checkRemoveConstraints should only check for protection and ignore mandatory definitions.
