RequestEntity, EntityEnclosingMethod have inconsistent Javadocs, use deprecated variables



Description:
Robert Manning <Robert.Manning at collabraspace.com> reported a problem on the
httpclient-user list regarding inconsistencies in javadoc of RequestEntity
interface and EntityEnclosingMethod class. This prompted me to review the said
classes. I have discovered several issues that must be dealt with before 3.0
goes final. 

(1) There's virtually no test coverage for the EntityEnclosingMethod class
(2) The code in EntityEnclosingMethod class extensively uses deprecated methods
and variables beyond what is required to maintain backward compatibility with
2.0.x API
(3) Existing code cannot gracefully handle faulty RequestEntity implementations
if the getContentLength method returns a negative value < -2

I have committed additional test cases to cover the most fundamental
functionality of EntityEnclosingMethod:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jakarta/commons/proper/httpclient/trunk/src/test/org/apache/commons/httpclient/TestEntityEnclosingMethod.java

I will submit a patch addressing issues (2) and (3) shortly

Oleg
