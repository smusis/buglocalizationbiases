bad assumptions in VersionHistoryTest.testInitallyGetAllVersionsContainsTheRootVersion()



Description:
There are two incorrect assumptions in testInitallyGetAllVersionsContainsTheRootVersion:

- getAllVersions() returns versions in a particular order (test assumes root version comes first), and

- Node.equals() is suitable for node comparison

And finally, there's a typo in the test case name.
