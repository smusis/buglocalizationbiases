Allow basic regexp in namespace prefix of index-rule



Description:
Currently a regular expression is limited to the local name, which makes fallback declarations that should match everything else difficult to write. I.e. you have to write a line per namespace in the node type registry, which bloats the index-rule unnecessarily.

Currently:

<property isRegexp="true">.*</property>

will only match properties with the empty namespace URI.

I propose we allow a basic regular expression in the prefix. That is the match all pattern: '.*' (dot star).

The following would match any property, including any namespace:

<property isRegexp="true">.*:.*</property>
