NullPointerException thrown when invalid header encountered



Description:
If a server returns a header with no name but with a value (ie: an invalid line in the headers), HttpClient throws a NullPointerException instead of just skipping that header line or perhaps treating it as a continuation of the previous header (need to consult the RFC to confirm this).

Problem reported by Eduardo Francos on the commons-user list.

A good test URL for this problem is:

which should return a 404 error but throws the NullPointerException instead.
