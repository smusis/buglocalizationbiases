IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers) doesn't correctly handle exception success flag.



Description:
After this bit of code in addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers)

 try {
        flush(true, false, true);
        optimize();					  // start with zero or 1 seg
        success = true;
      } finally {
        // Take care to release the write lock if we hit an
        // exception before starting the transaction
        if (!success)
          releaseWrite();
      }

The success flag should be reset to "false" because it's used again in another try/catch/finally block.  

TestIndexWriter.testAddIndexOnDiskFull() sometimes will hit this bug; but it's infrequent.
