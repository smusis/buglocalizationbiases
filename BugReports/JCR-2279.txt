Improve reusability of AbstractRepositoryService and AbstractReadableRepositoryService



Description:
Much of the functionality in AbstractReadableRepositoryService is not specific to reading but rather applies to any implementation (node types, name spaces, descriptors). I suggest to pull this functionality up from AbstractReadableRepositoryService to AbstractRepositoryService
