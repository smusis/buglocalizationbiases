[PATCH] jackrabbit-webapp pom.xml patch to create an additional jar artifact



Description:
Modifies the jackrabbit-webapp pom.xml to create a jar artifact in addition to the existing war artifact, to allow the jackrabbit-webapp utility servlets to be reused in other modules.

The right way would be to create a separate jar module for the servlets (or move them to jackrabbit-jcr-commons?), and reuse that jar as a dependency in the jackrabbit-webapp. So I'm not sure if this patch deserves to be applied to the trunk, but it can be useful as a workaround before a cleaner solution is implemented.
