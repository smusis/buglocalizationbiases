customize handling of 302 redirects



Description:
I tried this with both the beta2 2.0 release, and the nightly build.  The
following code snippet describes what I am trying to do:

httpClient.getHostConfiguration().setHost(sHost, 80, "http");
HttpMethod method=null;
if (sMethod.indexOf("POST")!=-1) {
     method=new PostMethod(sURLInfo);
} else {
     method=new GetMethod(sURLInfo);
}
method.setFollowRedirects(true);
httpClient.executeMethod(method);

After this code executes, the "getFollowRedirects" method still returns false,
and any redirects which are sent by the webserver are not followed.  As a
temporary workaround, since I want all redirects followed, I commented out the
following code in the HttpMethodBase class in the "processRedirectResponse" method:

/*if (!getFollowRedirects()) {
     LOG.info("Redirect requested but followRedirects is "
     + "disabled");
     return false;
}*/

If this bug has already been reported, I apologize...I searched for and found
nothing related to this issue.
