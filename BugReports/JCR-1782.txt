Destination header not containing URI scheme causes NPE



Description:
In WebDAVRequestImpl. getDestinationLocator assumes that URI.getAuthority is always non-null.

In RFC2518, a full URI is indeed required, but the NPE causes a status of 500, instead of 400 as expected.

In RFC4918, an absolute path is allowed.

Proposal: delegate to gethrefLocator, which already does the right thing.
