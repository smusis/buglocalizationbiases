automaton termsenum bug when running with multithreaded search



Description:
This one popped in hudson (with a test that runs the same query against fieldcache, and with a filter rewrite, and compares results)

However, its actually worse and unrelated to the fieldcache: you can set both to filter rewrite and it will still fail.
