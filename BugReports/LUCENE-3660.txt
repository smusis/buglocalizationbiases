If indexwriter hits a non-ioexception from indexExists it leaks a write.lock



Description:
the rest of IW's ctor is careful about this.

IndexReader.indexExists catches any IOException and returns false, but the problem
occurs if some other exception (in my test, UnsupportedOperationException, but you
can imagine others are possible), when trying to e.g. read in the segments file.

I think we just need to move the IR.exists stuff inside the try / finally
