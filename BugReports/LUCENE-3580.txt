Most 4.0 PostingsReaders don't obey DISI contract



Description:
While trying to do some refactoring, I noticed funky things going on with some codecs.

One problem is that DocIdSetIterator says the following:
{noformat}
Returns the following:
   * <ul>
   * <li>-1 or {@link #NO_MORE_DOCS} if {@link #nextDoc()} or
   * {@link #advance(int)} were not called yet.
{noformat}

But most 4.0 Docs/DocsAndPositionsEnums don't actually do this (e.g. return 0). instead we 
are relying on Scorers to 'cover' for them, which is inconsistent. Some scorers actually rely
upon this behavior, for example look at ReqExclScorer.toNonExcluded(), it calls docId() on the
excluded part before it calls nextDoc()

So we need to either fix these enums, change these enums to not extend DocIdSetIterator (and redefine
what the actual contract should be for these enums), change DocIdSetIterator, or something else.

Fixing the enums to return -1 here when they are uninitialized kinda sucks for the ones summing up
document deltas...
