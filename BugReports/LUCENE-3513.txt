Add SimpleFragListBuilder constructor with margin parameter



Description:
{{SimpleFragListBuilder}} would benefit from an additional constructor that takes in {{margin}}. Currently, the margin is defined as a constant, so to "implement" a {{FragListBuilder}} with a different margin, one has no choice but to copy and paste {{SimpleFragListBuilder}} into a new class that must be placed in the {{org.apache.lucene.search.vectorhighlight}} package due to accesses of package-protected fields in other classes.

If this change were made, the precondition check of the constructor's {{fragCharSize}} should probably be altered to ensure that it's less than {{max(1, margin*3)}} to allow for a margin of 0.
