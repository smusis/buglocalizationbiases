HttpClient does not properly handle 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' encoding



Description:
As always I'd like to pass on my thanks, I'm finding HttpClient really useful.

The problem occurs because I use Struts map based ActionForm and these generate 
request parameters of the form:

<input type="text" name="searchSelection(c)">

When this is submitted using the PostMethod class the generateRequestBody() is 
called and in turn this calls the URI.encode() method with a BitSet of the 
acceptable characters. In this case the '(' and ')' characters are marked as 
acceptable.

The problem is that this does not work correctly when I submit it to my remote 
server. If however I issue the request directly (from a webpage rather than 
using HttpClient) it works and when I examine the request input stream I can see 
that the parameter has been re-written so that 'select(c)' is displayed as 
'select%28c%29'.

This may be my error because of encoding problems or the fact I am not setting 
the content type etc. correctly. Or it could be a bug. I'm afraid my HTTP 
knowledge is not good enough.
