Add support for Digest authentication to the Authenticator class



Description:
Here's some code initially whipped up by Geza for Apache Axis, now adapted to
HTTPClient that adds support for Digest authentication to the Authenticator
class. I have tested this code against tomcat 4.0.4 with a sample code that
calls an Apache Axis Web Service. One caveat according to Geza, the code "Right
now does not support qop-int".
