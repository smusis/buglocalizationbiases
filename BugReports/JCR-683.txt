Bad transitive dependencies in commons-httpclient



Description:
As reported in HTTPCLIENT-605, the commons-httpclient 3.0 dependency introduces junit as a transitive "compile" scope dependency. The library also uses commons-logging, which sidesteps Jackrabbit's use of slf4j for logging.

To avoid these issues we should locally override the junit dependency in commons-httpclient and replace the commons-logging dependency with jcl104-over-slf4j.
