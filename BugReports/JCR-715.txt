Missing jackrabbit-rmi-service.xml from jackrabbit-jcr-rmi-1.2.1.jar



Description:
The file jackrabbit-rmi-service.xml is missing from the jackrabbit-jcr-rmi-1.2.1.jar.

The cause of the issue appears that the directory structure of the jackrabbit-jcr-rmi sub-project doesn't match the Maven 2 standard.  

To fix: src/resources should be moved to src/main/resources.
