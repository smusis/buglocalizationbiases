SQL2 Left Outer Join



Description:
Create this nodes.
def n1 = root.addNode("node1", "sling:SamplePage");
n1.setProperty("n1prop1", "page1");
def n2 = n1.addNode("node2", "sling:SampleContent");
n2.setProperty("n2prop1", "content1");

Execute this Query:
Select * from [sling:SamplePage] as page left outer join [sling:SampleContent] as content on ISDESCENDANTNODE(content,page) where page.n1prop1 = 'page1' and content.n2prop1 = 'content1';
The resultset have 1 row with 2 Nodes. This OK.

Then execute this:
Select * from [sling:SamplePage] as page left outer join [sling:SampleContent] as content on ISDESCENDANTNODE(content,page) where page.n1prop1 = 'page1' and content.n2prop1 = 'XXXXX';

The resultset has 1 row with 1 node.
This wrong. The result should be 0 rows.

Old Versions, prior 2.2.2 have also 0 rows as result.

Also, if nodes "n2" not exists, jackrabbit reports 1 row as result.
