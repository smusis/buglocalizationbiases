Adding DerbyDataStore to handle proper close of the embedded database



Description:
When using embedded Derby in conjunction with DbDataStore, the Derby database is never shutdown, as it requires special code to be executed (creating a Connection with ";shutdown=true")
We may provide a DerbyDataStore extending standard DbDataStore for handling that.
