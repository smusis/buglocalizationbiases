JCR2SPI does not provide actual size on RangeIterator.getSize()



Description:
Currently, JCR2SPI always returns -1 on RangeIterator.getSize().

This return value is legal (meaning "unknown"), but may cause clients to simply iterate through the whole list when what they really want is simply the count.

Use case:

"The use case is to count the number of members of a NT_FOLDER without having to open up the NT_FOLDER and count all the members (and I assume load them into memory) "

To make this happen we probably need to move away from simple Iterators on the SPI level, and put quite some additional work into JCR2SPI.

Feedback appreciated.
