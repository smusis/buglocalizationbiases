Can not set the "Proxy-connection" header



Description:
When using a proxy the HttpClient refuses to set the "Proxy-connection" header
to the value "close". The value will be converted to "keep-alive" when the final
request is sent to network.

The following code snippet can be used to replicate the defect. Method is GET:
...
method.removeRequestHeader("Proxy-Connection");
logger.debug("Proxy-Connection header removed.");
method.addRequestHeader("Proxy-Connection", "close");
logger.debug("Proxy-Connection header set to: " +
method.getRequestHeader("Proxy-Connection") );
try {
  	int statusCode = httpclient.executeMethod( method );
...

Now if you look at the wire log, you will notice that the actual value will be
"keep-alive".
