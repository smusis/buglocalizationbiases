Unreleased 2.3 version of IndexWriter.optimize()  consistly throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException out-of-the-box



Description:
Since the upcoming 2.3 version of Lucene has support for the setRAMBufferSizeMB() method in Index Writer,  I thought I would test its performance.   So, using my application that was built upon (and worked with) Lucene 2.2,  I downloaded the nightly build 2007-10-26_03-16-46 and rebuilt my application with new code setting setRAMBufferSizeMB() from a properties file.   My test data resides in a database table of 30 columns holding 1.25 million records.   The good news is that performance is superior to Lucene 2.2.  The indexing completes in roughly 1/3 the time.   The bad news is the Index Writer.optimize() step now throws an java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.
I also run tests against various other tables.  Indexing smaller amounts of data did not throw the exception.  Indexing largers amounts of data did throw the exception.  Note, I also tested nightly builds dating back to 2007-10-05.
