David Spencer Spell Checker improved



Description:
hy,
i developed a SpellChecker based on the David Spencer code (DSc) but more flexible.
the structure of the index is inspired of the DSc (for a 3-4 gram):
word:
gram3:
gram4:
 
3start:
4start:
..
3end:
4end:
..
transposition:
 
This index is a dictonary so there isn't the "freq" field like with DSc version.
it's independant of the user index. So we can add words becoming to several
fields of several index for example or, why not, to a file with a list of words.
The suggestSimilar method return a list of suggests word sorted by the
Levenshtein distance and optionaly to the popularity of the word for a specific
field in a user index. More of that, this list can be restricted only to words
present in a specific field of a user index.
 
See the test case.
 
i hope this code will be put in the lucene sandbox.
