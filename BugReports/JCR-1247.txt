Add Warnlog on Extraction Failure



Description:
It will be fine to have a feedback if a exception occurs in the TextExtractors.
At the moment only a empty StringReader will be returned.
We had the issue that we updated the content and in the textextractor a exception occured
so the index was not updated and the document was searchable by its old content.
