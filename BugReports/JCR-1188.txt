WebDAV: Allow for Extensions of MimeResolver in the Configuration.



Description:
Currently mime type detection is done using the content type header or (if missing) using a static MimeResolver instance in 
the IOUtil class. The MimeResolver itself reads from a properties file, that obviously does not list all possible extensions and
mimetypes.

This could be improved by:

- extending the resource configuration.
- extend the ImportContext and ExportContext interfaces
- replacing the current usages of IOUti#MIMERESOLVER by the corresponding calls on the Context classes which 
  themselves get a MimeResolver that is retrieved from the resource configuration.
