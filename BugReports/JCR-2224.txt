Change access levels in SearchIndex and NodeIndexer for better inherance



Description:
I want to change NodeIndexer#addBinaryValue logic in JR 1.5.6, therefore i needed to:
* create a custom class extending NodeIndexer for changing binary field indexation
* create a custom class extending SearchIndex for using this custom NodeIndexer

I was obliged to:
* override SearchIndex#createTextExtractor in order to store created TextExtractor because of private attribute
* put both classes into package org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene because NodeIndexer#createDoc(...) is protected

In trunk TextExtractor has now a getter but there are still some private attributes.
And NodeIndexer#createDoc(...) is still protected and there are some private methods.
