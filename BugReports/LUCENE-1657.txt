Make "boolean readOnly" a required arg to IndexReader.open



Description:
Most apps don't need read/write IndexReader, and, a readOnly
IndexReader has better concurrent performance.

I'd love to simply default readOnly to true, and you'd have to specify
"false" if you want a read/write reader (I think that's the natural
default), but I think that'd break too many back-compat cases.

So the workaround is to make the parameter explicit, in 2.9.

I think even for IndexSearcher's methods that open an IndexReader
under the hood, we should also make the parameter explicit.
