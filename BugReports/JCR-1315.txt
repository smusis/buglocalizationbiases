Add Google Analytics to Jackrabbit web site



Description:
I'd like to add Google Analytics to our web site to better track how the site is used and how much traffic we are generating.

Currently the best stats we have are at http://people.apache.org/~vgritsenko/stats/projects/jackrabbit.html, which is nice but not nearly as good as we could have.
