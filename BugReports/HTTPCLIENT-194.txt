httpClient does not support installation of different SSLSocketFactory



Description:
Description:

The SSLProtocolSocketFactory class had hard-
coded "javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory" as the socket factory.  It does not 
support installation of other socket factory.

Proposed Fix:

We added a setDefaultSSLSocketFactory method to the SSLProtocolSocketFactory 
and modified the code to use the factory it it is set.  The code falls back on 
using "javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory" if a default is not set.
