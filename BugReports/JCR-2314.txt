Open access modifier for RepositoryImpl.doShutdown()



Description:
This is required for a subclass of RepositoryImpl that wants to run additional code on shutdown, otherwise a deadlock may occur because the sequence of lock acquisition cannot be ensured.

Jackrabbit requires that the shutdownLock is first acquired and then the actual shutdown code is executed.
