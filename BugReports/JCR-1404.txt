javadoc writing and generation with mvn



Description:
"mvn -source 1.5 javadoc:javadoc" does not work because following lines must be added to pom.xml
<plugin>
      <artifactId>maven-javadoc-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <source>1.5</source>
      </configuration>
    </plugin> 
Please also write more comprehensive javadocs to allow better source understanding and developer co-operation
