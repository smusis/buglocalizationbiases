new QueryParser over-increment position for MultiPhraseQuery



Description:
If the new QP is parsing a phrase, and when the analyzer runs on the text within the phrase it produces some tokens with posIncr=0, a MultiPhraseQuery is produced.  But, the positions of the added terms are over-incremented, and don't match what the current QueryParser does.
