Field.setValue(...) doesn't properly handle switching between byte[] and other types



Description:
This came up in PyLucene testing, based on Lucene 2.4.1.  Thread here:

  http://pylucene.markmail.org/message/75jzxzqi3smp2s4z

The problem is that Field.setValue does not fix up the isBinary
boolean, so if you create a String field, and then do
setValue(byte[]), you'll get an exception when adding a document
containing that field to the index.
