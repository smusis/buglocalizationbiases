bad test assumptions in org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.lock



Description:
These tests make a lot of assumptions that may not be true for a compliant repository, such as:

- ability to add nodes without specifiying the node type
- assumption that ordering and same name siblings are supported
- assumption that addMixin(lockable) is required on newly added nodes

Furthermore, some repositories may not support shallow locks on leaf nodes. That's not compliant, but failure to do so should not abort a test that tests something else.
