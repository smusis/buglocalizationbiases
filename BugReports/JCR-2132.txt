o.a.j.core.state.ChildNodeEntries does not override equals(Object) and hashCode() methods



Description:
o.a.j.c.state.NodeStateMerger calls ChildNodeEntries.equals(ChildNodeEntries) to compare two child node entries collections.
ChildNodeEntries however doesn't override the equals(Object) method.
