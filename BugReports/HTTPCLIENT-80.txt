PostMethod - Chunked requests are not supported at the moment.



Description:
For Apache Axis, we'd like send a POST request without needing to calculate the
content-length for HTTP 1.1 based servers. Of course if the server-side does not
support 1.1 then a fallback mechanism could calculate the total size under the
covers.
