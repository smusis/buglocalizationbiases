XML import using MacOS X WebDAV client does not work



Description:
when trying to import a xml file via a webdav mount this does not work.

this is mainly because the client first tries to create a 0-sized file, which fails with the xml importer. after the file is created, it will lock it and put the xml body. a second problem might be the "dot-underscore" files mac tries to create.
