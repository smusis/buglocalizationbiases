Add offsets to postings (D&PEnum)



Description:
I think should explore making start/end offsets a first-class attr in the
postings APIs, and fixing the indexer to index them into postings.

This will make term vector access cleaner (we now have to jump through
hoops w/ non-first-class offset attr).  It can also enable efficient
highlighting without term vectors / reanalyzing, if the app indexes
offsets into the postings.
