Add sort-by-term with DocValues



Description:
There are two sorted byte[] types with DocValues (BYTES_VAR_SORTED,
BYTES_FIXED_SORTED), so you can index this type, but you can't yet
sort by it.

So I added a FieldComparator just like TermOrdValComparator, except it
pulls from the doc values instead.

There are some small diffs, eg with doc values there are never null
values (see LUCENE-3504).
