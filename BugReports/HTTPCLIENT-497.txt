Logger (Category) names don't follow common pattern



Description:
The Wire class uses two loggers named unexpected. The "org.apache.commons."
prefix is missing - so you can't mute all debug level statements with a
one-liner in you log4j.properties for example:

  log4j.logger.org.apache.commons.httpclient INFO

You have to add this, too:

  log4j.logger.httpclient INFO

Please prepend the "org.apache.commons." before both names.

Cheers,
Christian
