HttpClient incorrectly handles Transfer-Encoding header



Description:
RFC2616, section 4.4 item 3 states:
     If a Content-Length header field (section 14.13) is present, its
     decimal value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the
     transfer-length. The Content-Length header field MUST NOT be sent
     if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding
     header field is present). If a message is received with both a
     Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field,
     the latter MUST be ignored.

This is not handled correctly in the case that a noncompliant HTTP server
returns both a Transfer-Encoding header and a Content-Length header.

I gave up on writing a TestCase for this as it would require a reliably
noncompliant HTTP Server.
