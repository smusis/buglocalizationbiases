DateParser refactoring; Stateful cookie specs



Description:
Presently DateParser is tightly coupled with the DefaultHttpParams class. I find
this sub-optimal from the design standpoint. Moreover, I believe that date
patterns should be specifiable at the method, host, and client levels, not only
global one. Currently this is not the case, and out of sync with the rest of the
preference framework, which can result in quite a bit of confusion.

When refactoring the DateParser class I also realized that the cookie specs were
shared by all the HttpMethod instances and as such had to be stateless. Even
though it is presently the case, technically there's nothing that prevents the
user from implementing a stateful cookie spec, plugging it into HttpClient, and
by doing so potentially causing quite unpleasant concurrency issues. Therefore,
I believe pluggable cookie specs MAY NOT be shared. There should be a cookie
spec instance created per method invocation
