JSR 283: Node Type Attribute Subtyping Rules 



Description:
JCR 2.0 clarifies node type attribute subtyping rules whereas JCR 1.0 didn't mandate any specific behavior.

"3.7.6.7 Node Type Attribute Subtyping Rules" states  (assume T' being a subtype of T):

- if T has orderable child nodes then T' must have orderable child nodes
- if T specifies a primary item then T' inherits that setting and must not override it
