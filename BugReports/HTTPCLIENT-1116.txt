ResponseCachingPolicy uses integers for sizes



Description:
ResponseCachingPolicy currently uses integers for interpreting the size of Content-Length, as well internally.

This causes issues in attempting to use the module for caching entities that are over 2GB in size, the module does not fail gracefully, but throws a NumberFormatException

I have a patch that fixes this, by promoting the int -> long, which should allow for larger entities to be cached, it also updates the public facing API where possible, I don't think that the promotion should break compatibility massively

The changes can also be seen here:
