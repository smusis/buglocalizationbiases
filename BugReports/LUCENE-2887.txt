Remove/deprecate IndexReader.undeleteAll



Description:
This API is rather dangerous in that it's "best effort" since it can only un-delete docs that have not yet been merged away, or, dropped (as of LUCENE-2010).

Given that it exposes impl details of how Lucene prunes deleted docs, I think we should remove this API.

Are there legitimate use cases....?
