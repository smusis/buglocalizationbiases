RangeQuery - add equals and hashCode methods



Description:
I'm attaching a patch with an equals() and hashCode() implementation for 
RangeQuery.java, and a new unit test for TestRangeQuery.java, as per a recent 
message on lucene-user mailing list (subject "RangeQuery doesn't override 
equals() or hashCode() - intentional?")

patches to follow
