Workspace.xml can't be loaded if it has a BOM



Description:
I wondered if there was a specific reason why workspace.xml files are loaded using a FileReader instead of an InputStream in RepositoryConfig?

If the workspace.xml file has a BOM (which could happen if someone edited the file manually with some misbehaving editor), then it can't be loaded ("Content not allowed in prolog") - here's a little patch that fixes this.

I left the output part untouched (i.e still using a Writer) - which makes it a little inconsistent - maybe someone with a better knowledge of the JR FileSystem api could fix this.
