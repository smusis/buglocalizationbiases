Move to jackrabbit.apache.org



Description:
Jackrabbit will be moving to

   http://jackrabbit.apache.org/

There are a number of infrastructure tasks that will need to be done by Roy.

There will also be a need to change our documentation and site to point to the new URL
and mailing list addresses, which can be done by anyone.

The existing mailing lists will be moved

    jackrabbit-dev at incubator  -->  dev at jackrabbit.apache.org
    jackrabbit-commits at incubator  -->  commits at jackrabbit.apache.org

and I will add

   users at jackrabbit.apache.org
