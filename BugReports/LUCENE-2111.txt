Wrapup flexible indexing



Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-1458.

The flex branch is in fairly good shape -- all tests pass, initial search performance testing looks good, it survived several visits from the Unicode policeman ;)

But it still has a number of nocommits, could use some more scrutiny especially on the "emulate old API on flex index" and vice/versa code paths, and still needs some more performance testing.  I'll do these under this issue, and we should open separate issues for other self contained fixes.

The end is in sight!
