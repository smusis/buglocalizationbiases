Improved logging for session operations



Description:
I'd like to add the following logging features to SessionOperations:

* Use MDC [1] to make it possible to filter and redirect logs based on which session is being used
* Add simple debug-level timing information for executed SessionOperations to help pinpoint performance issues
* Classify SessionOperations as read or write operations, and log warnings (instead of the current debug messages) for concurrent writes on a session
