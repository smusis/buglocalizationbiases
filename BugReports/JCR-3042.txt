jcr-commons: add cnd writer functionality



Description:
currently jcr-commons only provides an cnd-reader while the writer functionality is only present in spi-commons.
for JCR-2948 a implementation independent cnd-writer would be useful and i would therefore suggest to
add this to jcr-commons based on the code present in spi-commons and let the implementation in spi-commons
extend from the general functionality.
