[PATCH] When locks are disabled, IndexWriter.close() throws NullPointerException



Description:
If locks are disabled (via setting the System property 'disableLuceneLocks' to
true), IndexWriter throws a NullPointerException on closing. The reason is that
the attempt to call writeLock.release() fails because writeLock is null.
To correct this, just check for this case before releasing. A (trivial) patch is
attached.
