Duplicate attribute in BeanDescriptor and CollectionDescriptor



Description:
2 different attributes are used in BeanDescriptor and CollectionDescriptor to store the jcr type (jcrType and jcrNodeType). JcrNodeType can be removed. 
This imply modifications in  the DTD, the pm implementation and the different mapping xml files used for the unit tests. 

Furthermore, it should be nice to use the same name (jcrType)  in all descriptors.  There is a lot of confusion across the different descriptors. sometime jcrType is used, sometime jcrNodeType is used. I propose to use only jcrType with the following purpose : 

* In the ClassDescriptor, it  is used to store the primary node type of the class. 
* In the FieldDescriptor, it  is used to store the property type. 
* In the BeanDescriptor  it is used to defined the child node type. 
* In the CollectionDescriptor , it is used to defined the child node type.
