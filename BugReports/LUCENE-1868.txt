update NOTICE.txt



Description:
From the java-dev discussion, NOTICE.txt should be up-to-date.

One thing I know, is that the persian stopwords file (analyzers/fa) came from the same source as the arabic stopwords file, and is BSD-licensed. 

There might be others (I think ICU has already been added)
