Index creates many folders when re-indexing



Description:
When the repository is re-indexed the search index creates a lot of directories, which are finally cleaned up. If the repository contains a lot of content the number of directories that are created can be quite high (thousands of directories).

The re-indexing process should clean up unused index folders right away and not wait until the changes are committed.
