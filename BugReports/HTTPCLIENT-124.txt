MultipartPost closes input stream



Description:
This is something of a collection of issues that are all interrelated.

1. MultipartPost calls close on the outputstream it retrieved from 
HttpConnection which causes an exception to be thrown later on.  This call 
should be replaced with a call to flush().

2. The MultipartPost classes do not have any logging in them.  We should add 
trace statements at a minimum.

3. new FilePart(String, File) throws a null pointer exception.

4. The tests in TestPartsNoHost are broken.

I'll attach patches for these fixes in a moment, broken down as much as 
possible.
