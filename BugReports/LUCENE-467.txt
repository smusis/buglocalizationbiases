Use Float.floatToRawIntBits over Float.floatToIntBits



Description:
Copied From my Email:
  Float.floatToRawIntBits (in Java1.4) gives the raw float bits without
normalization (like *(int*)&floatvar would in C).  Since it doesn't do
normalization of NaN values, it's faster (and hopefully optimized to a
simple inline machine instruction by the JVM).

On my Pentium4, using floatToRawIntBits is over 5 times as fast as
floatToIntBits.
That can really add up in something like Similarity.floatToByte() for
encoding norms, especially if used as a way to compress an array of
float during query time as suggested by Doug.
