Node.restore() may throw InvalidItemStateException



Description:
It seems that ItemManager cache is not maintained correctly. I'm getting InvalidItemStateException: 'propertyId' has been modified externally tryin restore/checkout versionable nodes in single thread.

ItemState should be evicted from ItemStateManager cache when modified, it seems that status of ItemState is changed to MODIFIED, but itemState remains in the cache.
