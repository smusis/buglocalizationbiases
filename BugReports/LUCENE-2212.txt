add a test for PorterStemFilter



Description:
There are no tests for PorterStemFilter, yet svn history reveals some (very minor) cleanups, etc.
The only thing executing its code in tests is a test or two in SmartChinese tests.

This patch runs the StemFilter against Martin Porter's test data set for this stemmer, checking for expected output.

The zip file is 100KB added to src/test, if this is too large I can change it to download the data instead.
