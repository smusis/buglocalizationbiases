Brazilian Analyzer doesn't remove stopwords when uppercase is given



Description:
The order of filters matter here, just need to apply lowercase token filter before removing stopwords

	result = new StopFilter( result, stoptable );
		result = new BrazilianStemFilter( result, excltable );
		// Convert to lowercase after stemming!
		result = new LowerCaseFilter( result );

Lowercase must come before BrazilianStemFilter

At the end of day I'll attach a patch, it's straightforward
