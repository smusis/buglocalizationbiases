Description:
I have a doc which contains html codes. I want to strip html tags and make the test clear after then apply highlighter on the clear text . But highlighter throws an exceptions if I strip out the html characters  , if i don't strip out , it works fine. It just confuses me at the moment 

I copy paste 3 thing here from the console as it may contain special characters which might cause the problem.


1 -) Here is the html text
