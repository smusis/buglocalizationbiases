allow case insensitive searches



Description:
would be nice to be able to search specific properties like a fulltext search, e.g. with an ignore-case flag, so you could find a subset of the results of

  select * from nt:base where contains('bla')

using something like

  select * from nt:base where jcr:bla like '%bla%'

(currently, the value must contain 'bla' exactly as it is to be found by the second query)

i suggest to extend the contains function with an additional argument for the property to search in, e.g.

  select * from nt:base where contains('bla',jcr:bla)

this could then also easily be used in XPath.
