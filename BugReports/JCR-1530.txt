MsPowerPointTextExtractor does not extract from PPTs with € sign



Description:
The MsPowerPointTextExtractor class has a problem when reading PPTs when an € sign is contained. All text following that sign is ignored. Perhaps the POI PowerPointExtractor should be used instead of parsing the data by hand. As a side effect, this would simply the code. Extracting could be done as follows:

	public Reader extractText(InputStream stream, String type, String encoding) throws IOException {
		try {
			PowerPointExtractor extractor = new PowerPointExtractor(stream);
			return new StringReader(extractor.getText(true,true));
		} catch (RuntimeException e) {
			logger.warn("Failed to extract PowerPoint text content", e);
			return new StringReader("");
		} finally {
			try { stream.close(); } catch (IOException ignored) {}
		}
	}
