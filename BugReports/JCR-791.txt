Improve performance of MatchAllScorer



Description:
The BitSets created in MatchAllScorer should be cached per IndexReader. This enhancement should also take care that the supplied IndexReader may in fact be a CombinedIndexReader or a CachingMultiReader with multiple contained IndexReaders. To achieve a good cache efficiency the BitSets must be cached per contained IndexReader and combined later.
