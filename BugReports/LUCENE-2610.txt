addIndexes(Directory...) should not trigger merge on flush()



Description:
IndexWriter.addIndexes(Directory..) calls flush() w/ triggerMerge=true. This beats the purpose of the changes done to addIndexes to not merge any segments and leave it as the application's choice. The change is very simple - pass false instead of true. I don't plan to post a patch, however opened an issue in case some want to comment about it.
