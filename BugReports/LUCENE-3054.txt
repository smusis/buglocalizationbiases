SorterTemplate.quickSort stack overflows on broken comparators that produce only few disticnt values in large arrays



Description:
Looking at Otis's sort problem on the mailing list, he said:
{noformat}
* looked for other places where this call is made - found it in
MultiPhraseQuery$MultiPhraseWeight and changed that call from
ArrayUtil.quickSort to ArrayUtil.mergeSort
* now we no longer see SorterTemplate.quickSort in deep recursion when we do a
thread dump
{noformat}

I thought this was interesting because PostingsAndFreq's comparator
looks like it needs a tiebreaker.

I think in our sorts we should add some asserts to try to catch some of these broken comparators.
