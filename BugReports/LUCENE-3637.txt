Make IndexReader.decRef() call refCount.decrementAndGet instead of getAndDecrement



Description:
IndexReader.decRef() has this code:

{code}
    final int rc = refCount.getAndDecrement();
    if (rc == 1) {
{code}

I think it will be clearer if it was written like this:

{code}
    final int rc = refCount.decrementAndGet();
    if (rc == 0) {
{code}

It's a very simple change, which makes reading the code (at least IMO) easier. Will post a patch shortly.
