replace text from an online collection (used in few test cases) with text that is surely 100% free.



Description:
Text from an online firstaid collection (firstaid . ie . eu . org)  is used as arbitrary text for test documents creation, in:
   o.a.l.analysis.Analyzer.FunctionTestSetup.DOC_TEXT_LINES
   o.a.l.benchmark.byTask.feeds.SimpleDocMaker.DOC_TEXT

I once got this text from Project Gutenberg and was sure that it is free. But now the referred Web site does not seem to respond, and I can no more find that firstaid eBook in the Project Gutenberg site.

Since it doesn't matter what text we use there, I will just replace that with some of my own words...
