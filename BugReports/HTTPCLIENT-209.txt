Add set/getLocalAddress methods to HostConfiguration



Description:
On clustered or multi-homed systems, there's a need to specify the local bind
address of sockets, to ensure that they're created on the right interface.  To
do this, the local address needs to be passed to the 4-argument version of
ProtcolSocketFactory.createSocket.

After discussion on the mailing list, the best approach for this seems to be
adding the local address as a property on HostConfiguration and HttpConnection.  

I've attached a patch which does the following:
- Add public set/getLocalAddress methods to HostConfiguration and HttpConnection.
- HttpConnection uses the local address when opening connections.
- Modify HostConfiguration.equals and hostEquals to compare the local address too.
- SimpleHttpConnectionManager uses the local address from the provided config. 
I also cleaned up its getConnection method a bit.
- HttpClient.executeMethod uses the local address from its default
HostConfiguration if the method's config doesn't specify one.
