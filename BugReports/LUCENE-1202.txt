The clover setup for Lucene currently has some problems, 3 i think...

1) instrumentation fails on contrib/db/ because it contains java packages the ASF Clover lscence doesn't allow instrumentation of.  i have a patch for this.

...i'm not sure what's going on here.  the error seems to happen both when
trying to run clover on just a single contrib, or when doing the full
build ... i suspect there is an issue with the way the batchtests fork
