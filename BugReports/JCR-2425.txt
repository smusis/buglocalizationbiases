Session.save() and Session.refresh(boolean) rely on accessibility of the root node



Description:
follow-up issue to JCR-2418:

an editing session that is only allowed to write in a subtree but isn't allowed to access the root node will not be
able to save or revert changes made in the transient space within that subtree.

the reason for this is, that both SessionImpl.save() and SessionImpl.refresh(boolean) access the root node
in order to execute the call. since it's the regular call READ permissions are checked, although the user
made no attempt to *look* at the root.

A workaround would be to call Item.save() on the modified tree itself that obviously was visible for the 
user... unfortunately that method is deprecated as of JCR 2.0. Therefore, I have the impression that we
should fix the methods mentioned above.
