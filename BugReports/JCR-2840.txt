Inconsistencies if "everyone" Group is created by User Management



Description:
currently the 'everyone' principal used to define ACEs that apply for all regular users in the repository is hardcoded in the
principal management. this leads to inconsistencies if a group (or user) is created within the user management that has a principal 
name 'everyone'.
