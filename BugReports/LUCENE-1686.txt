Remove Unnecessary NULL check in FindSegmentsFile - cleanup



Description:
FindSegmentsFile accesses the member "directory" in line 579 while performing a null check in 592. The null check is unnecessary as if directory is null line 579 would throw a NPE.
I removed the null check and made the member "directory" final. In addition I added a null check in the constructor as If the value is null we should catch it asap.
