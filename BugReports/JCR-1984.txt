UserManagement: Limit set of properties exposed by AuthorizableImpl



Description:
AuthorizableImpl currently exposes all properties present on the Node representing the user/group. This should be limited to the properties set through the API (i.e. the non-protected props defined by the rep:Authorizable node type)
