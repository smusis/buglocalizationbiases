[PATCH] Make a getter for SortField[] fields in org.apache.lucene.search.Sort



Description:
I'm have my own Collector and I would like to use the Sort object within my
collector, but SortField[] fields; is not accessible outside Lucene's package.
Can you please consider making a public getFields() method in the Sort object so
we can use it in our implementation?
