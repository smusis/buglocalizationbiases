BasicAuthenticatonExample.java in CVS



Description:
From the example in CVS Revision 1.1.2.1 the code below would lead you to 
belive that setCredentials uses ("HOST", "REALM", credientials). It actually 
should be ("REALM", "HOST", credientials). It looks like it was correct in the 
Revision 1.1 and was changed with Revision 1.1.2.1

// pass our credentials to HttpClient, they will only be used for
// authenticating to servers with realm "realm", to authenticate agains
// an arbitrary realm change this to null.
client.getState().setCredentials(
            "www.verisign.com",
            "realm",
            new UsernamePasswordCredentials("username", "password")
);
