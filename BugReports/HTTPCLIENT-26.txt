need a way to set request body in PostMethod



Description:
Currently, there is no way for user to set the request body in PostMethod 
directly. The only way to do that is by adding parameters to PostMethod. This 
makes sense in most cases. However, there are situations that the user actually 
knows the request body and want to set it directly. adding the following method 
fixes this:

    public void setRequestBody(String requestBody)
    {
        this.requestBody = requestBody;
    }
