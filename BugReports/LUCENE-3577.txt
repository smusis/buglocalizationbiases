rename expungeDeletes



Description:
Similar to optimize(), expungeDeletes() has a misleading name.

We already had problems with this on the user list because TieredMergePolicy
didn't 'expunge' all their deletes.

Also I think expunge is the wrong word, because expunge makes it seem
like you just wrangle up the deletes and kick them out of the party and
that it should be fast.
