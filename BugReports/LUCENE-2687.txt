Remove Priority-Queue size trap in MultiTermQuery.TopTermsBooleanQueryRewrite



Description:
These APIs are new in 3.x, so we can do this with no backwards-compatibility issue:

Before 3.1, FuzzyQuery had its own internal rewrite method.
We exposed this in 3.x as TopTermsBooleanQueryRewrite, and then as subclasses for Scoring and Boost-only variants.

The problem I have is that the PQ has a default (large) size of Integer.MAX_VALUE... of course its later limited by
the value of BooleanQuery's maxClauseCount, but I think this is a trap.

Instead its better to simply remove these defaults and force the user to provide a default (reasonable) size.
