Add SimpleText codec



Description:
Inspired by Sahin Buyrukbilen's question here:

  http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/b68846e383824653/how_to_export_lucene_index_to_a_simple_text_file#b68846e383824653

I made a simple read/write codec that stores all postings data into a
single text file (_X.pst), looking like this:

{noformat}
field contents
  term file
    doc 0
      pos 5
  term is
    doc 0
      pos 1
  term second
    doc 0
      pos 3
  term test
    doc 0
      pos 4
  term the
    doc 0
      pos 2
  term this
    doc 0
      pos 0
END
{noformat}

The codec is fully funtional -- all Lucene & Solr tests pass with
-Dtests.codec=SimpleText -- but, its performance is obviously poor.

However, it should be useful for debugging, transparency,
understanding just what Lucene stores in its index, etc.  And it's a
quick way to gain some understanding on how a codec works...
