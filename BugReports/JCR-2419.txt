WorkspaceAccessManager defined with SecurityManager that keeps users per workspace must test if user exists



Description:
the WorkspaceAccessManager defined with the security manager keeping users per workspace currently returns true upon calls to grant(Set, String) if
a workspace with the given name exists.

while this is fine for the initial check upon session creation, it obviously isn't for all method calls that test for accessible workspace names, such as
Workspace#getAccessibleWorkspaceName, Workspace#clone and copy across workspaces.

instead it should test if any of the specified principals corresponds to a valid user within the workspace identified by the given workspaceName.
