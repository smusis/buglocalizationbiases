Czech Stemmer



Description:
Currently, the CzechAnalyzer is merely stopwords, and there isn't a czech stemmer in snowball.

This patch implements the light stemming algorithm described in: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1598600

In their measurements, it improves MAP 42%

The analyzer does not use this stemmer if LUCENE_VERSION <= 3.0, for back compat.
