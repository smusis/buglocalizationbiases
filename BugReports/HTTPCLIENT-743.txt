Duplicate log of HTTP header



Description:
The HTTP header line:

"HTTP/1.1 200 OK[\r][\n]" 

is duplicated in the wire logs. Seems to be because the line is logged at:

HttpParser [line: 131] - readLine(InputStream, String)

and at:

HttpMethodBase [line: 1980] - readStatusLine(HttpState, HttpConnection)

It looks like the latter log should be removed?
