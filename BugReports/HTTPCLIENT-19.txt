Response Folded Headers throws HttpException



Description:
As of 4/4/02 CVS repository the HttpMethodBase class
doesn't handle folded headers in the 
readResponseHeaders method

HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/1.0 descriptions of folded headers (see 
section 2.2 Basic Rules)

I've prepared a patch and was 
emailed to jakarta-commons@jakarta.apache.org
