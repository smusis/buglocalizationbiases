Make IndexReader/Searcher ctors readOnly=true by default



Description:
Another "change the defaults" in 3.0.

Right now you get a read/write reader from IndexReader.open and new IndexSearcher(...), and reserving the right to write causes thread contention (on isDeleted).

In 3.0 let's make readOnly reader the default, but still allow opening a read/write IndexReader.
