build.xml: result of "dist-src" should support "build-contrib"



Description:
Currently the packed src distribution would fail to run "ant build-contrib".
It would be much nicer if that work.
In fact, would be nicer if you could even "re-pack" with it.

For now I marked this for 2.1, although I am not yet sure if this is a stopper.
