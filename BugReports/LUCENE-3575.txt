Field names can be wrong for stored fields / term vectors after merging



Description:
The good news is this bug only exists in trunk... the bad news is it's
been here for some time (created by accident in LUCENE-2881).  But the
good news is it should strike fairly rarely.

SegmentMerger sometimes incorrectly thinks it can bulk-copy TVs/stored
fields when it cannot (because field numbers don't map to the same
names across segments).

I think it happens only with addIndexes, or indexes that have
pre-trunk segments, and then SM falsely thinks it can bulk-merge only
when the last field number has the same field name across segments.
