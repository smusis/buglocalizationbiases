Spellchecker should take IndexWriterConfig... deprecate old methods?



Description:
When looking at LUCENE-3490, i realized there was no way to specify the codec for the spellchecker to use.

It has the following current methods:
* indexDictionary(Dictionary dict): this causes optimize!
* indexDictionary(Dictionary dict, int mergeFactory, int ramMB): this causes optimize!
* indexDictionary(Dictionary dict, int mergeFactor, int ramMB, boolean optimize)

But no way to specify an IndexwriterConfig. Additionally, I don't like that several of these ctors force an optimize in a tricky way,
even though it was like this all along.

So I think we should add indexDictionary(Dictionary dict, IndexWriterConfig config, boolean optimize).

We should either deprecate all the other ctors in 3.x and nuke in trunk, or at least add warnings to the ones that optimize.
