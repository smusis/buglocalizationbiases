Move Jackrabbit Query Parser from core to spi-commons



Description:
The query parser can be used outside jackrabbit-core, for instances in other repository implementations based on JCR2SPI.

Proposal:

- move source and build infrastructure from o.a.j.core.query to o.a.j.spi.commons.query

- switch over jackrabbit.core to use spi-commons for query

- optimally, add specific test cases for the query tree generation.
