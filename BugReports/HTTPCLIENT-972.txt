caching module should use HttpParams-style configuration



Description:
The constructor for CachingHttpClient currently accepts combinations of:
* HttpCache
* HttpClient
* integer for max object size in bytes

As I started looking at being able to configure this for behaving as a non-shared cache, I realized that we actually want to be replacing that last int with an HttpParams argument, and tracking all the various options in that style. I have a patch with this update which I will upload shortly.
