Allow redirects between hosts and ports



Description:
Redirects to different hosts, ports and protocols are currently prevented. 
Historicly, HttpMethodBase.checkValidRedirects() is used to prevent these types
of redirects due how state information was being managed in the connection.  

Much has changed since then.  We should relax the check and allow for redirects
 between hosts and ports. 

Redirects across protocols should not be considered at this time as there are
other issues related to security that is best left up to the user of HttpClient.
