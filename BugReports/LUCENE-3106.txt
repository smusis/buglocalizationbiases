commongrams filter calls incrementToken() after it returns false



Description:
In LUCENE-3064, we beefed up MockTokenizer with assertions, and I started cutting over some analysis tests to use MockTokenizer for better coverage.

The commongrams tests fail, because they call incrementToken() after it already returns false. 

In general its my understanding consumers should not do this (and i know of a few tokenizers that will actually throw exceptions if you do this, just like java iterators and such).
