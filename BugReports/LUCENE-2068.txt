fix reverseStringFilter for unicode 4.0



Description:
ReverseStringFilter is not aware of supplementary characters: when it reverses it will create unpaired surrogates, which will be replaced by U+FFFD by the indexer (but not at query time).
The wrong words will conflate to each other, and the right words won't match, basically the whole thing falls apart.

This patch implements in-place reverse with the algorithm from apache harmony AbstractStringBuilder.reverse0()
