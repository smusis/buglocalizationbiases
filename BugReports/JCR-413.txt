JCA will not compile with J2EE1.3 classes



Description:
In JCAManagedConnectionFactory, the constructor invoked to throw ResourceException does not exist under J2EE1.3 / JCA1.1 classes.
 throw new ResourceException(e)  -  line 136 and line 277.

Instead the code needs to do something like:

            ResourceException exception = new ResourceException("Failed to create session");
            exception.setLinkedException(e);
            throw exception;

This will allow it to compile/run under J2EE1.3
