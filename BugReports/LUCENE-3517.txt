Fix pulsingcodec to reuse its enums



Description:
PulsingCodec currently doesnt always reuse its enums, which could lead to behavior like LUCENE-3515.

The problem is sometimes it returns the 'wrapped' enum, but other times it returns its 'pulsingenum' depending upon
whether terms are pulsed...

we can use the fact that these enums allow attributes to keep the reuse information for both so it can reuse when stepping through terms.
