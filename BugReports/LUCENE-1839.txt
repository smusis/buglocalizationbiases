Scorer.explain is deprecated but abstract, should have impl that throws UnsupportedOperationException



Description:
Suggest having Scorer implement explain to throw UnsupportedOperationException

right now, i have to implement this method (because its abstract), and javac yells at me for overriding a deprecated method

if the following implementation is in Scorer, i can remove my "empty" implementations of explain from my Scorers
{code}
  /** Returns an explanation of the score for a document.
   * <br>When this method is used, the {@link #next()}, {@link #skipTo(int)} and
   * {@link #score(HitCollector)} methods should not be used.
   * @param doc The document number for the explanation.
   *
   * @deprecated Please use {@link IndexSearcher#explain}
   * or {@link Weight#explain} instead.
   */
  public Explanation explain(int doc) throws IOException {
    throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
  }
{code}

best i figure, this shouldn't break back compat (people already have to recompile anyway) (2.9 definitely not binary compatible with 2.4)
