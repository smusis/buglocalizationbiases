Add support for encrpted db password in repository.xml



Description:
Basically this is same to the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-2673. I can not reopen JCR-2673, so I filed a new one instead. 

The reason for this jira is because for a lot of companies it is not allowed to store password in a clear text. 

Sorry, I dont know how this can be implemented yet. But I hope at least the requirement is clear. 

Thanks.
