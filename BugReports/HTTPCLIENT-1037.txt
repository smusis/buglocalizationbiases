FormBodyPart code does not agree with ContentDescriptor Javadoc wrt nullability of mimeType and transferEncoding



Description:
The FormBodyPart does not agree with ContentDescriptor Javadoc wrt nullability of mimeType and transferEncoding:

The code in FormBodyPart explicitly allows mimeType and transferEncoding to be null, in which case the relevant header is not generated.
This is useful behaviour, as the headers are not necessaruly needed.

However the bahaviour disagrees with the Javadoc in the ContentDescriptor interface - null is not allowed.
Also, AbstractContentBody does not allow mime-type to be null.
