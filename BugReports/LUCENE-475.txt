 RAMDirectory(Directory dir, boolean closeDir)  constructor uses memory inefficiently.



Description:
recently I found that  RAMDirectory(Directory dir, boolean closeDir)  constructor uses memory inefficiently.
files from source index are read entirely intro memory as single byte array which is after all is thrown away. And if I want to load my 200M optimized, compound format index to memory for faster search I should give JVM at least 400Mb memory limit. For larger indexes this can be an issue.

I've attached patch how to solve this problem.
