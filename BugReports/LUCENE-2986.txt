divorce defaultsimilarityprovider from defaultsimilarity



Description:
In LUCENE-2236 as a start, we made DefaultSimilarity which implements the factory interface (SimilarityProvider), and also extends Similarity.

Its factory interface just returns itself always by default.

Doron mentioned it would be cleaner to split the two, and I thought it would be good to revisit it later.

Today as I was looking at SOLR-2338, it became pretty clear that we should do this, it makes things a lot cleaner. I think currently its confusing to users to see the two apis mixed if they are trying to subclass.
