Reported by Johan Stuyts - http://www.nabble.com/Possible-documentation-error--p7012445.html - 

Frequency file example says: 

     For example, the TermFreqs for a term which occurs once in document seven and three times in document eleven would be the following sequence of VInts: 
         15, 22, 3 

It should be: 

     For example, the TermFreqs for a term which occurs once in document seven and three times in document eleven would be the following sequence of VInts: 
         15, 8, 3
