NodeTypeRegistry.registerNodetypes(Collection) should not register a partial set



Description:
the javadoc says:

     * Note that in the case an exception is thrown, some node types might have
     * been nevertheless successfully registered.

the problem hereby is, that it cannot be determined easily, what nodetypes could be registered, and which couldnt. i would rather prefer a all-or-nothing behaviour.
