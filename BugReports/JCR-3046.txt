Improve exception handling in observation (ChangePolling)



Description:
Currently when an (internal) event listener throws an exception, all further event listeners are skipped. This happens for move events where the HierarchyListener throws an UnsupportedOperationException. I suggest to move the exception handler up the call chain such that exceptions are caught and logged per listener instead of for all listeners.
