ArrayHits does not end properly when skipTo doesn't find document



Description:
If skipTo(target) does not find a document that that has a higher value than the target, it falls out of the loop and calls next() possibly returning a previously found document. The patch makes sure that -1 is returned in this case, otherwise confusing results might occur.
