SPI: Describe equality requirements of ItemIds



Description:
Michael Duerig asked for clarification regarding the equality of  ItemIds.

While discussing this we came to the following conclusion:

Two ItemIds should be considered equal if both the unique part and the path part are equal AND if they denote the same type of id (see #denotesNode).

If nobody objects i would adjust the javadoc of ItemId accordingly.
