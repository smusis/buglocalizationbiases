CachingHttpClient returns a 503 response when the backend HttpClient produces an IOException



Description:
The CachingHttpClient returns an HTTP 503 response when the backend HttpClient throws an IOException.

It happens for instance when the backend is DefaultHttpClient (AbstractHttpClient), issuing a request to a server not listening on the target port.
Well, it sounds tricky, but it makes the HttpClient not having a consistant behaviour in an implementation using both caching and regular clients.

If a 503 should really be returned in that case, I suggest the AbstractHttpClient to return it and the CachingHttpClient to just propagate any exception thrown by the backend.
