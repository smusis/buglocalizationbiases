Cosmetic JavaDoc updates



Description:
I've taken the liberty of making a few cosmetic updates to various JavaDocs:

* MergePolicy (minor cosmetic change)
* LogMergePolicy (minor cosmetic change)
* IndexWriter (major cleanup in class description, changed anchors to JavaDoc links [now works in Eclipse], no content change)

Attached diff from SVN r780545.

I would appreciate if whomever goes over this can let me know if my issue parameter choices were correct (yeah, blame my OCD), and if there's a more practical/convenient way to send these in, please let me know :-)
