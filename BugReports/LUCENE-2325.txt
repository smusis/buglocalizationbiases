investigate solr test failures using flex



Description:
We have a branch of Solr located here: https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/solr/branches/solr

Currently all the tests pass with lucene trunk jars.

I plopped in the flex jars and they do not, so I thought these might be interesting to look at.
