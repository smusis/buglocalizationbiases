Usage of "qualified name" in JavaDoc and Comments



Description:
Within jackrabbit the term "qualified name" is used, when the internal representation of a JCR name is referred according to the usage of "fully-qualified name" within the JSR 170 specification.

Based on input by julian (Issue #449) the phrasing has been adjusted in JSR 283 to match the terminology used in XMLNS.

As of JSR 283

- Qualified Name -> refers to a JCR Name in the form prefix:localname
- Expanded Name -> is used for what was formerly called "fully-qualified name".

In order to avoid confusion i would suggest to fix the javadoc throughout the project and eventually add explanations in cases where method or class names are misleading.
