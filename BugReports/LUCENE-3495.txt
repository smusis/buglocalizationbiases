BlockJoinQuery doesn't implement boost



Description:
After reviewing LUCENE-3494, i checked other queries and noticed that BlockJoinQuery currently throws UOE for getBoost and setBoost:
{noformat}
throw new UnsupportedOperationException("this query cannot support boosting; please use childQuery.setBoost instead");
{noformat}

I don't think we can safely do that in queries, because other parts of lucene rely upon this working... for example BQs rewrite when
it has a single clause and erases itself.

So I think we should just pass down the boost to the inner weight.
