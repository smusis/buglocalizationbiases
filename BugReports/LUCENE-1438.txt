StandardTokenizer splits host names with hyphens into multiple tokens



Description:

StandardTokenizer does not recognize host names with hyphens as a single HOST token. Specifically "www.m-w.com" is tokenized as "www.m" and "w.com", both of "<HOST>" type.

StandardTokenizer should instead output a single HOST token for "www.m-w.com", since hyphens are a legitimate character in DNS host names.

We've a local fix to the grammar file which also required us to significantly simplify the NUM type to get the behavior we needed for host names.

here's a junit test for the desired behavior;

	public void testWithHyphens() throws Exception {
		final String host = "www.m-w.com";
		final StandardTokenizer tokenizer = new StandardTokenizer(
				new StringReader(host));
		final Token token = new Token();
		tokenizer.next(token);
		assertEquals("<HOST>", token.type());
		assertEquals("www.m-w.com", token.term());
	}
