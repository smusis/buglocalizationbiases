Inadequate HTTP proxy server support in HttpClient.



Description:
1. The HttpClient class does not save the StatusLine from the hidden
ConnectMethod object used to connect via an HTTP proxy server, thus any proxy
failures are only picked up as 'anonymous exceptions', this is useless for
gracefull recovery and rapid debugging.

2. The current class structure is too fragile to neatly support HTTP Proxy (and
authenication) chains so it would be a good idea to look at this at the same
time, preferable with support for a Proxy chain redirect when an non/dead HTTP
Proxy server is found.
