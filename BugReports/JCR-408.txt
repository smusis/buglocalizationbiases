RowIterator view of result for query '//*' only returns jcr:path column



Description:
The RowIterator view of a query result for '//*' only returns the jcr:path column. The spec states that this query is equivalent to:
select * from nt:base. Furthermore a query that selects * properties must return all non-residual properties that are declared for this node type and are not multi-valued. The pseudo properties jcr:path and jcr:score must always be available.

For nt:base this is:
- jcr:primaryType
- jcr:path
- jcr:score
