DefaultHttpParamsFactory.getDefaultParams() is not thread safe



Description:
The method getDefaultParams() in 
org.apache.commons.httpclient.params.DefaultHttpParamsFactory is not thread 
safe.  In this code:

    public HttpParams getDefaultParams() {
        if (httpParams == null) {
            httpParams = createParams();
        }

        return httpParams;
    }

it is possible that httpParams will be called by one thread which will set 
httpParams, then a second thread may call it and may find httpParams is 
non-null.  However, under both the old (Java Language Spec chapter 17) and 
new Java Memory Models, the second thread won't necessarily see the values 
the first thread has set in the referenced HttpParams object.

The easiest way to fix this for all JVMs and memory models is by declaring 
getDefaultParams() to be synchronized.
