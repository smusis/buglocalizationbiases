Add a LATENT FieldSelectorResult



Description:
I propose adding LATENT FieldSelectorResult

this would be similar to LAZY_LOAD except that it would NEVER cache the stored value

This will be useful for very large fields that should always go direct to disk (because they will take so much memory)
when caching Documents returned from a Searcher, the large field may be initially requested as LAZY_LOAD, however once someone reads this field, it will then get locked into memory. if this Document (and others like it) are cached, it can start to use a very large amount of memory for these fields

Contract for FieldSelectorResult.LATENT should be that it will always be pulled direct from the IndexInput and never be persisted in memory as part of a Fieldable

I could prepare a patch if desired
