add infrastructure for longer running nightly test cases



Description:
I'm spinning this out of LUCENE-2762...

The patch there adds initial infrastructure for tests to pull documents from a line file, and adds a longish running test case using that line file to test NRT.

I'd like to see some tests run on more substantial indices based on real data... so this is just a start.
