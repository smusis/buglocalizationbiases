Pre-analyzed fields



Description:
Adds the possibility to set a TokenStream at Field constrution time, available as tokenStreamValue in addition to stringValue, readerValue and binaryValue.

There might be some problems with mixing stored fields with the same name as a field with tokenStreamValue.
