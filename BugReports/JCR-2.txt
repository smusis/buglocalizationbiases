Mavenize Project



Description:
Mavenize project pending mailing list feedback.

I'm attaching an out-dated zip that has some useful "stuff" to review or build upon.

Proposed flow:

1) Review the maven specific elements in the zip:
- project.xml, header.txt, license.txt, notice.txt, checkstyle.xml, project.properties, xdocs directory. NOTE: I know the license.txt and maybe header.txt are not correct per earlier discussions.
2) Once new package layout/code is in svn - we can refactor this and move the maven related files into place.

Thoughts,
  a) One of the artifacts generated is the bat file and supporting directory with the jar to run the sample app - could use some ideas on how maven should generate this.
  b) How the local maven repo gets the jcr-api.jar? My current thinking is 'same as any non-redistributable artifact'. The user is responsible for downloading it to a local repository.
