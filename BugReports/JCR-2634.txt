weird error when adding a node using an abstract/mixin nodetype



Description:
when trying to add a node "files" with an abstract nodetype, i.e. nt:base, the following error is reported:

javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: {}files is abstract  be used as primary node type.

the correct wording could be:

javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: not allowed to add node {}files: {http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0}base is abstract and cannot be used as primary node type.
