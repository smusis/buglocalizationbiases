StackOverflowError in HttpConnection



Description:
When the HttpConnection#WrappedOutputStream.flush () encounters IOException 
druign write, it is calling HttpConnection.close which calls 
HttpConnection.closeSocketAndStreams and which eventually calls 
HttpConnection#WrappedOutputStream.flush again.  The circular calls will cause 
StackOverflowError.

I run into this accidentally when I was trying to extend HttpConnection.  But 
looking through the code, I believe any IOException may cause the same 
problem.  The circular calls should be either removed or controlled.  Below is 
part of teh stack trace
