Exception shouldn't be thrown for unsupported authentication method



Description:
Currently, Authenticator will throw an UnsupportedOperationException for 
unsupported authentication method (like NTLM). This is correct. However,  
HttpMethodBase.execute only catches HttpException, so this 
UnsupportedOperationException is leaked to the user. This is undesirable, 
because user may want a chance to handle such such authentication themself. The 
correct way is to pass the http status code to the user, just like how it 
treats redirect to a different host.

The simple fix is to catch all exceptions in HttpMethodBase.execute when 
calling Authenticator.authenticate.
