WebDAV Library: VersionControlledResource constant lists wrong method



Description:
VersionControlledResource .methods_checkedIn constant lists UNCHECKOUT which is obviously
wrong.

RFC3253 lists the UNCHECKOUT method as mandatory method for checked-out vc-resource
for the 'checkout-in-place'  feature.
