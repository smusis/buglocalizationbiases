IndexWriter should prune 100% deleted segs even in the NRT case



Description:
We now prune 100% deleted segs on commit from IW or IR (LUCENE-2010),
but this isn't quite aggressive enough, because in the NRT case you
rarely call commit.

Instead, the moment we delete the last doc of a segment, it should be
pruned from the in-memory segmentInfos.  This way, if you open an NRT
reader, or a merge kicks off, or commit is called, the 100% deleted
segment is already gone.
