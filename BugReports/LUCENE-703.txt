Change QueryParser to use ConstantScoreRangeQuery in preference to RangeQuery by default



Description:
Change to QueryParser to default to using new ConstantScoreRangeQuery in preference to RangeQuery
for range queries. This implementation is generally preferable because it 
a) Runs faster 
b) Does not have the scarcity of range terms unduly influence score 
c) avoids any "TooManyBooleanClauses" exception.

However, if applications really need to use the old-fashioned RangeQuery and the above
points are not required then the  "useOldRangeQuery" property can be used to revert to old behaviour.

The patch includes extra Junit tests for this flag and all other Junit tests pass
