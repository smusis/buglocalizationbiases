Preemptive auth flags disregarded during ssl tunnel creation



Description:
Using a Squid2.4 proxy, the connection is dropped when trying to connect to a 
ssl site. In order for the connection to remain open, preemptive authorization 
is needed for the proxy. The preemptive authorization flags are not propagated 
down to where the ssl tunnel is created in HttpMethodDirectors executeConnect 
method. A new ConnectMethod object is created for the tunnel but the preemptive 
flags set as parameters are not being set on the new ConnectMethod object.

Here is the code that would replicate the problem using a Squid(2.4) proxy :

HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
client.getHostConfiguration().setProxyHost(new ProxyHost("someproxy", 3128));
client.getParams().setAuthenticationPreemptive(true);
client.getState().setProxyCredentials(AuthScope.ANY, new 
UsernamePasswordCredentials("user", "password"));
GetMethod httpget = new GetMethod("https://www.verisign.com/");
httpget.getProxyAuthState().setPreemptive();
client.executeMethod(httpget);
httpget.releaseConnection();
