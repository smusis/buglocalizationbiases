Unable to create repository using jackrabbit-webapp because a directory called "jackrabbit" already exists



Description:
I mount the jackrabbit-webapp.war in a Jetty installation
* at startup i have the following exception:
ERROR RepositoryStartupServlet: Either create thejackrabbit/bootstrap.properties file or
ERROR RepositoryStartupServlet: use the '/config/index.jsp' for easy configuration.
ERROR RepositoryStartupServlet: RepositoryStartupServlet initializing failed: javax.servlet.ServletException: Repository startup configuration is not valid.
* then when i access http://localhost:8080/ i am forwarded to the page:
 http://localhost:8080/bootstrap/missing.jsp
* creating the repository by clicking on "Create Content Repository" button fails complaining that the jackrabbit directory already exists

Indeed, i find a jackrabbit directory in my JETTY_HOME (from where is started Jetty).

A workaround is to delete this "jackrabbit" directory and then i can create the repository by clicking on the previous button and therefore access the newly created repository.
