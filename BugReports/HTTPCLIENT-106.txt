Path should not be encoded in HttpMethodBase



Description:
I suggest to change the protocol or add a new method for this one

protected static String generateRequestLine(HttpConnection connection,
	String name, String reqPath,
	String qString, String protocol);
so that we can choose to use URIUtil.encode(reqPath, URIUtil.pathSafe()) or not

The reason is that after the encoding process, some server cannot recognize this
Actually, I am handling a project of the Method Propfind(for getting mail from 
Hotmail) and I find that the restriction of Hotmail server is quite high, and 
if the address is encoded, it does not work.
