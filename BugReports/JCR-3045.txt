ResourceConfig: read additional parameters for IOHandler and PropertyHandler that are covered by public setters



Description:
the reason for this is that currently default node types used in DefaultHandler cannot be changed using the resource config, which is
a bit cumbersome and leads to useless copies of DefaultIOManager.
