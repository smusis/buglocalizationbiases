PayloadTermQuery refers to a deprecated documentation for redirection 



Description:
When PayloadTermQuery refers to the function for scoring Similarity - it refers to override the deprecated method - 

Similarity#scorePayload(String, byte[],int,int) . 

That method has been deprecated by  Similarity#scorePayload(int, String, int, int, byte[],int,int) . 


This javadoc patch addresses the class level javadoc for the class to provide the right signature in Similarity to be overridden.
