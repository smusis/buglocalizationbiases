Invalid redirects are not corrected



Description:
If a get is made to a page with a query argument containing a space, many web
servers, notably including Tomcat 5 can generate a redirect in which the space
in the query argument is not escaped correctly.  Most browsers including IE and
Firefox compensate for this by quoting any included spaces in the redirect
location.  Http client does not.  When this broken URL is presented to a
subsequent server, the GET command is interprted incorrectly resulting (usually)
in a 505.

The fix is to replace spaces in redirect locations with +'s.  This doesn't
entirely fix the problem but that is the job of the web server developers.
