Offset not working correctly in user/group query when restricting to group members



Description:
For user/group queries having a scope *and* a  limit clause offsetting does not work correctly.

    builder.setScope("contributors", false);
    builder.setLimit(100, 50);

In the above case, the result is often not offset at 100 but instead at some place >100.
