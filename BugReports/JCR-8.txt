Multiple PropertyDefs with same name not possible



Description:
when adding property defs with the same name but different settings, for example one singlevalued, one multivalued, only the last is respected when creating a property.

problem is the 'namedItemDefs' HashMap in the EffectiveNodeType which rather must contain a list of defs rather than the def itself.
