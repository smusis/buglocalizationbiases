add FieldInvertState.numUniqueTerms, Terms.sumDocFreq



Description:
For scoring systems like lnu.ltc (http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec16/papers/ibm-haifa.mq.final.pdf), we need to supply 3 stats:
* average tf within d
* # of unique terms within d
* average number of unique terms across field

If we add FieldInvertState.numUniqueTerms, you can incorporate the first two into your norms/docvalues (once we cut over),
the average tf within d being length / numUniqueTerms.

to compute the average across the field, we can just write the sum of all terms' docfreqs into the terms dictionary header,
and you can then divide this by maxdoc to get the average.
