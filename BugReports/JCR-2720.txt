Changes from Session.move() to a top-level node aren't seen in a second session



Description:
I'll attach a test case, but basically...

* Create two sessions
* Create a top-level node in the first session and save it.
* Move the top-level node using the first session
* In the second session, try itemExists() for the path of the node. It returns true when it should be false.
