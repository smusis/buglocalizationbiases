Add support for tablespaces to Oracle related classes



Description:
When a user account for an Oracle database has no or a temporary default tablespace, then the appropriate database schemas cannot be created. This is an issue for at least the following packages:
- o.a.j.core.persistence.bundle
- o.a.j.core.persistence.db
- o.a.j.core.fs.db
