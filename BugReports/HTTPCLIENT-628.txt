AutoCloseInputStream.available() throws IOException when auto-closed



Description:
ACIS auto-close itself as soon as EOF is detected. That leads to IOExceptions being throw in response to calls that are valid for a stream that has reached EOF.
ACIS should instead close the _underlying_ stream and switch itself into an EOF mode that does not throw exceptions until it is closed explicitly.
