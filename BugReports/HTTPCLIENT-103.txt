ChunkedInputStream incorrectly handles chunksize without semicolon



Description:
ChunkedInputStream does not correctly read the chunk size when a semicolon does
not appear in the first line of the chunk.  If whitespace exists between the
chunk size value and the end of line and no semicolon is present, the whitespace
is not removed before parseInt is called resulting in an IOException "Bad chunk
size"

I can not tell from RFC2616 if whitespace is legal here, but I have received it
from at least one web server.  The relevant section is 3.6.1.

A small patch repairs the problem.  I will attach it immediately.
