UUID field not populated when saving a new node



Description:
In the following 'Article' class, there is are fields set to true for 'path' and 'uuid' jcr properties. 
The mixins for referencing (hence, support for UUID) are declared at the @Node level of the class. 

After saving the node with the ObjectContentManager, the uuid field is not populated as it could be expected

@Node(jcrMixinTypes="mix:referenceable,mix:lockable,mix:versionable")
public class Article {

        @Field(uuid=true)
        private String id = null;
       
        @Field(path=true)
        private String path = null;
       
        @Field
        private String content = null;

        ... constructor, getters and setters
}
