UUIDDocId should check IndexReader using equals()



Description:
The method UUIDDocId.getDocumentNumber(IndexReader) tests the passed index reader using its object identity.

This is a left over when there was one index per workspace and no system index. When the system index was introduced each query execution will create a new CombinedIndexReader covering the workspace index and the system index. The method should now use the equals() method to test the passed IndexReader.
