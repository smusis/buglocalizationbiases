Change Term to use bytes



Description:
in LUCENE-2426, the sort order was changed to codepoint order.

unfortunately, Term is still using string internally, and more importantly its compareTo() uses the wrong order [utf-16].
So MultiTermQuery, etc (especially its priority queues) are currently wrong.

By changing Term to use bytes, we can also support terms encoded as bytes such as numerics, instead of using
strange string encodings.
