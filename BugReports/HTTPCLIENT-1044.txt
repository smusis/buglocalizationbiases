DefaultHttpRequestRetryHandler is not handling PUT as an idempotent method for retries, though RFC2616 section 9.1.2 clearly defines it to be one.



Description:
See attached patch file for a fix:

Fix treats PUT requests as idempotent, marking them to be retried when their enclosed HttpEntity is either null or repeatable.
