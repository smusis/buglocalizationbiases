HTTPClient 4.1 auto slash removal



Description:

I am using httpclient 4.1. I had a problem with this fix. In DefaultRequestDirector.rewriteRequestURI method, for non-proxied URI and when it is a absolute URI, it will call the URIUtils.rewriteURI, which then take the "RawPath" from an uri and normalize it. So when I pass an uri, for example, http://www.whatever.com/1//3, it will automatically remove the extra slash and become http://www.whatever.com/1/3. I've got a REStful service to accept the uri (/{param1}/{param2}/{param3}) and it takes when there is an empty value past in. Now because of the auto slash removal, the "3" value shift left for a position and match to the {param2}. I wouldn't say the above solution is wrong, but I guess it should not change what value that user pass in.
