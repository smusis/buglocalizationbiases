Run 'test-tag' in nightly build



Description:
Changes in this trivial patch:
- ant target 'nightly' now also depends on 'test-tag'
- adds property 'compatibility.tag' to common-build.xml that should always point to the last tagged release; its unit tests will be downloaded unless -Dtag="" is used to override
- 'download-tag' does not fail if the svn checkout wasn't successful; instead 'test-tag' checks if the specified tag is checked-out and available, if not it fails
