DirectoryTaxonomyWriter extensions should be able to set internal index writer config attributes such as info stream



Description:
Current protected openIndexWriter(Directory directory, OpenMode openMode) does not provide access to the IWC it creates.
So extensions must reimplement this method completely in order to set e.f. info stream for the internal index writer.
