Invalid query results when using jcr:like with a case transform function and a pattern not starting with a wildcard



Description:
If the repository contains nodes with the following value for the property name :
john
JOhn
joe
Joey

and we run the following query :
//element(*, document)/*[jcr:like(fn:lower-case(@name), 'joh%')]")
then all the previous nodes will match especially the last 2 nodes.

The reason is the use of two range scans from the lucene term index:
..._name_jOH
..................
..._name_joh_

and

..._name_JOH
..................
..._name_Joh_

The first range will contains ..._name_joe property and the second will contains ..._name_Joey.
But the pattern 'joh%' and so the regexp '.*' because of the range scan will match
the substring values of the properties ('' in the first range and 'y' in the second range).

The solution is to use the full pattern (ie 'joh.*') for matching each properties.
