Contrib Analyzer Setters should be deprecated and replace with ctor arguments



Description:
Some analyzers in contrib provide setters for stopword / stem exclusion sets / hashtables etc. Those setters should be deprecated as they yield unexpected behaviour. The way they work is they set the reusable token stream instance to null in a thread local cache which only affects the tokenstream in the current thread. Analyzers itself should be immutable except of the threadlocal. 

will attach a patch soon.
