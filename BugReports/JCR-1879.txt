"Directory was previously created with a different LockFactory" when open, close, delete a repository in a loop



Description:
Opening a TransientRepository in a loop throws the exception "Directory was previously created with a different LockFactory instance".

Test case:

for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	FileUtils.deleteDirectory(new File("repository"));
	Repository rep = new TransientRepository();
	Session session = rep.login(new SimpleCredentials("", new char[0]));
	session.logout();
}

The problem seems to be that org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.DIRECTORIES is not cleared (FSDirectory.close() is not called?).

Stack trace:
