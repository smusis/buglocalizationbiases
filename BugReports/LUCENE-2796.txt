Tests need to clean up after themselves



Description:
I havent run 'ant clean' for a while.

The randomly generated temporarily file names just piled up from running the tests many times... so ant clean is still running after quite a long time.

We should take the logic in the base solr test cases, and push it into LuceneTestCase, so a test cleans up all its temporary stuff.
