AbstractReadableRepositoryService should pass credentials to createSessionInfo



Description:
Currently AbstractReadableRepositoryService.obtain() calls checkCredentials() followed by createSessionInfo() where it only passes the userId rather than the credentials. In many cases an implementation will need the credentials to create the SessionInfo.
