Workspace is shut down while creating initial index



Description:
This only happens when a maxIdleTime is configured for the workspaces in the repository.xml and the workspace to index is not the default workspace.

The idle check considers a workspace as idle when there only a system session is open and the configured idle time elapsed. This is also the case when the workspace is initializing.

The repository should either check if a workspace is still initializing or we need to move the search manager initialization into the WorkspaceInfo.doInitialize() method.
