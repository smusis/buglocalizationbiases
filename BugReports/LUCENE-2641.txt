BaseTestRangeFilter can be extremely slow



Description:
The tests that extend BaseTestRangeFilter can sometimes be very slow:
TestFieldCacheRangeFilter, TestMultiTermConstantScore, TestTermRangeFilter

for example, TestFieldCacheRangeFilter just ran for 10 minutes on my computer before I killed it,
but i noticed these tests frequently run for over a minute.

I think at the least we should change these to junit4 so the index is built once in @beforeClass
