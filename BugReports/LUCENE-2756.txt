MultiSearcher.rewrite() incorrectly rewrites queries



Description:
This was reported on the userlist, in the context of range queries.

Its also easy to make our existing tests fail with my patch on LUCENE-2751:
{noformat}
ant test-core -Dtestcase=TestBoolean2 -Dtestmethod=testRandomQueries -Dtests.seed=7679849347282878725:-903778383189134045
{noformat}

The fundamental problem is that MultiSearcher first rewrites against individual subs, 
then uses Query.combine() which simply OR's these sub-clauses.

This is incorrect for expanded MUST_NOT queries (e.g. from wildcard), as it violates demorgan's law.
