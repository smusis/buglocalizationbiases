Path.getAncestor and Path.isAncestor are not symmetric



Description:
Although the method names refer to ancestors they operate on sub-paths. Consider:

PathFactory pf = PathFactoryImpl.getInstance();
Path.Element p = pf.getParentElement();

Path path = pf.create(new Path.Element[]{p, p});
Path ancestor = path.getAncestor(1);

assertFalse(ancestor.isAncestorOf(path) )  

This is not what one would expect from looking an the method signatures. 
I suggest to rename getAncestor to getSubPath, clarify the javadoc, and deprecate getAncestorCount. 

A patch follows.
