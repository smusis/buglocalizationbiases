MockCharFilter offset correction is wrong



Description:
This is a fake charfilter used in basetokenstreamtestcase.

it occasionally doubles some characters, and corrects offsets.

its used to find bugs where analysis components would fail otherwise with charfilters,
but its correctOffset is actually wrong (harmless to any tests today, but still wrong).
