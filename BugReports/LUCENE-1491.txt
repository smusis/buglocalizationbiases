EdgeNGramTokenFilter stops on tokens smaller then minimum gram size.



Description:
If a token is encountered in the stream that is shorter in length than the min gram size, the filter will stop processing the token stream.

Working up a unit test now, but may be a few days before I can provide it. Wanted to get it in the system.
