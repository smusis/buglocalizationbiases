Missing XPath escape in query.jsp



Description:
As reported by Canberk Bolat of ADEO Security in a private communication, there search.jsp script in jackrabbit-webapp is missing an escape when it injects the path of a "related:" query into the constructed XPath statement. Further analysis showed that this issue has no security implications, so we can treat this as a normal bug report.

search.jsp
...
String q = request.getParameter("q");
...
      if (q != null && q.length() > 0) {
           String stmt;
           if (q.startsWith("related:")) {
               String path = q.substring("related:".length());
               stmt = "//element(*, nt:file)[rep:similar(jcr:content,
'" + path + "/jcr:content')]/rep:excerpt(.) order by @jcr:score
descending";
               queryTerms = "similar to <b>" +
Text.encodeIllegalXMLCharacters(path) + "</b>";
           }
