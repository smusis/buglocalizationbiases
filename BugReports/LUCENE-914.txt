Scorer.skipTo(current) remains on current for some scorers

Background in http://www.nabble.com/scorer.skipTo%28%29-contr-tf3880986.html

It appears that several scorers do not strictly follow the spec of Scorer.skipTo(n), and skip to current location remain in current location whereas the spec says: "beyond current". 

We should (probably) either relax the spec or fix the implementations.
