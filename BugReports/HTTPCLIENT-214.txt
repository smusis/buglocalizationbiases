HttpClient drops connection to the proxy when an invalid 'connection: close' directive is encountered in 'connection established' response



Description:
One of our customer is using our application to connect to our servlet using 
https.  We are using httpClient for http protocol handling.  The customer has a 
IBM proxy (see log file).  The connect failed with a null pointer exception.

The log seem to indicate that the proxy server is returning 200 for "CONNECT", 
but the proxy also sends a "Connection:close" header.  The httpClient closed 
the connection and then tried to create the SSL socket.  If the proxy server is 
incorrect in sending 200 with "Connection:close", then httpClient should throw 
exception for invalid state (IllegalStateException ?).

I will attach the log file.
