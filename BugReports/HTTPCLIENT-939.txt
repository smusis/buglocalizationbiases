302 response without location header throws exception



Description:
Hi, 

According to HTTP 1.1 Spec : http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3
"The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s)."

Now, in "DefaultRedirectStrategy.getLocationURI()", there's a ProtocolException thrown if location header is null.  

if (locationHeader == null) {
    // got a redirect response, but no location header
    throw new ProtocolException(
        "Received redirect response " + response.getStatusLine()
       + " but no location header");
 }

The specs says "SHOULD" and not "MUST". ProtocolException "signals that an HTTP protocol violation has occurred", which is not exactly true.
