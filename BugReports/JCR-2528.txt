spi2dav: ItemInfoCache causes failure of (Workspace)RestoreTest#testRestoreWithUUIDConflict and variants



Description:
while running the API version tests i found the (Workspace)RestoreTest.testRestoreWithUUIDConfict and variants failing. to be precise the test passes but
transiently removing the versionableNode2 in the teardown fails upon removal of the jcr:uuid property of the moved childnode.

having a closer look at it revealed that the problem is caused in the WorkspaceItemStateFactory where the property entry is retrieved from the
cache and subsequently checking if the path really matches fails. for test purposes i prevented the usage of the cached entry by returning false in WorkspaceItemStateFactory.isUpToDate  => the tests passed. 

as far as i know the same tests pass with spi2jcr.
michael, could it be that this is caused by a flaw in the iteminfo-cache logic? or is there something specific that needs to be adjusted in spi2dav?
