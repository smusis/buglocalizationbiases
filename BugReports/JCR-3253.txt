Set omit term freq positions flag on parent field in the index



Description:
The flag to omit term frequencies is set to true by default and it is not changed by any of the constructors on the Field class.
We don't use this info in the index anyway, so it is safe to remove it.

The index size gain for 130K nodes (3 leves, ~50 nodes per level) is around 150kb for a 30mb index.
