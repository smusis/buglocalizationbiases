deprecate ChineseAnalyzer



Description:
The ChineseAnalyzer, ChineseTokenizer, and ChineseFilter (not the smart one, or CJK) indexes chinese text as individual characters and removes english stopwords, etc.

In my opinion we should simply deprecate all of this in favor of StandardAnalyzer, StandardTokenizer, and StopFilter, which does the same thing.
