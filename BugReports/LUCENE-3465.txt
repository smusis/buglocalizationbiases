IndexSearcher fails to pass docBase to Collector when using ExecutorService



Description:
This bug is causing the failure in TestSearchAfter.

We are now always passing docBase 0 to Collector when you use ExecutorService with IndexSearcher.

This doesn't affect trunk (AtomicReaderContext carries the right docBase); only 3.x.
