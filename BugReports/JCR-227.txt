move core module to a subdirectory



Description:
Actually the jackrabbit svn holds the code for the main module in the top level dir
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk/
and all the subprojects in subdirectories
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk/contrib/

given this layout is not possible to checkout from svn only the main module (if you get trunk, you get all), and you can't work to different modules using any IDE which doesn't support nested projects (namely Eclipse).

I would like to request moving the main module (that means moving all the files and directories in trunk except "contrib") from 
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk/
to 
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit
following the usual organization of maven-based projects and solving these problems...
