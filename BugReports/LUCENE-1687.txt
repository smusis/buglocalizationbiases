Remove ExtendedFieldCache by rolling functionality into FieldCache



Description:
It is silly that we have ExtendedFieldCache.  It is a workaround to our supposed back compatibility problem.  This patch will merge the ExtendedFieldCache interface into FieldCache, thereby breaking back compatibility, but creating a much simpler API for FieldCache.
