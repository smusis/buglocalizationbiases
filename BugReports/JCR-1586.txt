Create org.apache.jackrabbit.api.jsr283 (in jackrabbit-api) and move future jsr283 interfaces and classes there



Description:
(as discussed on mailing list)

as the implementation of the new features for jsr283 have started, i
suggest to put the new jsr283 interfaces to jackrabbit-api instead to
core (where possible). this way, we can already figure out
inter-module dependency issues and people can start using experimental
features through an API than rather through casting objects to core
interfaces.

suggestion: use 'org.apache.jackrabbit.api.jsr283' as base package for
the new jsr283 interfaces and classes.

for example, use
org.apache.jackrabbit.api.jsr283.nodetype.NodeDefinitionTemplate
for the future javax.jcr.nodetype.NodeDefinitionTemplate

once jcr2.0 is released, we will drop the interim interfaces.
