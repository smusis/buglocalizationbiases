Range Query works only with lower case terms



Description:
I am performing a range query that returns results if the terms are lower 
case, but does not return result when the terms are mixed case.

In my collection, I have terms alpha, beta, delta, gamma.  I am using the 
StandardAnalyzer for both indexing and searching.

The query [alpha TO gamma] returns all four terms.  When I perform the query 
[Alpha TO Gamma], no results are returned.

It appears the lowerCaseFilter(), which is a part of the StandardAnalyzer, 
does not work properly on the search terms.  I've used Luke to peek at my 
collection, and the terms are all lower case in the collection.

I'm fairly new to Lucene, so I hope I'm not making a "common mistake".
