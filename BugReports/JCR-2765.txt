JCR-SQL2 : no count when WHERE clause is provided



Description:
whenever you provide a where-clause to a sql2 select, jcr/jackrabbit does not provide the hit count.

E.g.:
   select * from [nt:unstructured]
   order by [jcr:score]
returns the hit count (query.execute().getRows().getSize()), 
whereas
  select * from [nt:unstructured]
  where entity = "customer"
  order by [jcr:score]
doesn't.
