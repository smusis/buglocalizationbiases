Improve maven artifacts



Description:
There are a couple of things we can improve for the next release:
- "*pom.xml" files should be renamed to "*pom.xml.template"
- artifacts "lucene-parent" should extend "apache-parent"
- add source jars as artifacts
- update <generate-maven-artifacts> task to work with latest version of maven-ant-tasks.jar
- metadata filenames should not contain "local"
