Add deleteByQuery to IndexWriter



Description:
This has been discussed several times recently:

If we add deleteByQuery to IndexWriter then this is a big step towards
allowing IndexReader to be readonly.

I took the approach suggested in that first thread: I buffer delete
queries just like we now buffer delete terms, holding the max docID
that the delete should apply to.

Then, I also decoupled flushing deletes (mapping term or query -->
actual docIDs that need deleting) from flushing added documents, and
now I flush deletes only when a merge is started, or on commit() or
close().  SegmentMerger now exports the docID map it used when
merging, and I use that to renumber the max docIDs of all pending
deletes.

Finally, I turned off tracking of memory usage of pending deletes
since they now live beyond each flush.  Deletes are now only
explicitly flushed if you set maxBufferedDeleteTerms to something
other than DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH.  Otherwise they are flushed at the
start of every merge.
