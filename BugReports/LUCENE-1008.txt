document with no term vector fields after documents with term vector fields corrupts the index



Description:
If a document with no term-vector-enabled fields is added after
document(s) that did have term vectors, as part of a single set of
buffered docs, then the term-vector documents file is corrupted
because we fail to write a "0" vInt.

Thanks to Grant for spotting this!
