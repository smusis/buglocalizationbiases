Track total term freq per term



Description:
Right now we track docFreq for each term (how many docs have the
term), but the totalTermFreq (total number of occurrences of this
term, ie sum of freq() for each doc that has the term) is also a
useful stat (for flex scoring, PulsingCodec, etc.).
