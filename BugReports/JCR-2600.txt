AbstractLoginModule logs a warning on anonymous logins



Description:
Currently a "No credentials available -> try default (anonymous) authentication" warning is logged by AbstractLoginModule whenever an anonymous login is made. Since this is a normal situation, the log message should be at debug or at most info level.
