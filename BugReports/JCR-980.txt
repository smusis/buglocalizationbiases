Single quote in contains function is not parsed correctly



Description:
If there is a single quote in the contains statement the parser will throw an exception.

Example:
//element(*, nt:resource)[jcr:contains(., 'it''s fun')]

The LuceneQueryBuilder replaces the single quote with a double quote and hence the lucene fulltext query parser fails because there is a missing closing double quote. Not sure why this is done in the code, maybe this is a left over from an early JSR 170 draft.
