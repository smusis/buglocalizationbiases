https should check CN of x509 cert



Description:
https should check CN of x509 cert

Since we're essentially rolling our own "HttpsURLConnection",  the checking provided by "javax.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier" is no longer in place.

I have a patch I'm about to attach which caused both createSocket() methods on o.a.h.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory to blowup:

test1: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: hostname in certificate didn't match: <vancity.com> != <www.vancity.com>
test2: javax.net.ssl.SSLException: hostname in certificate didn't match: <vancity.com> != <www.vancity.com>

Hopefully people agree that this is desirable.
