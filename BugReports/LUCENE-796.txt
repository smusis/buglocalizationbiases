Change Visibility of fields[] in MultiFieldQueryParser



Description:
In MultiFieldQueryParser the two methods 

  protected Query getFuzzyQuery(String field, String termStr, float minSimilarity) throws ParseException
  protected Query getWildcardQuery(String field, String termStr) throws ParseException

are intended to be overwritten if one would like to avoid fuzzy and wildcard queries. However, the String[] fields attribute of this class is private and hence it is not accessible in subclasses of MFQParser. If you just change it to protected this issue should be solved.
