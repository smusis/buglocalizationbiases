Remove/Uncommit SegmentingTokenizerBase



Description:
I added this class in LUCENE-3305 to support analyzers like Kuromoji,
but Kuromoji no longer needs it as of LUCENE-3767. So now nothing uses it.

I think we should uncommit before releasing, svn doesn't forget so
we can add this back if we want to refactor something like Thai or Smartcn
to use it.
