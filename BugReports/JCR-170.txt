VirtualItemStates of node types definitions not accessible with uuid



Description:
The VirtualNodeTypeStateProvider that maps node type definitions into the workspace under /jcr:system/jcr:nodeTypes does not implement the methods:

- internalGetNodeState(NodeId id)
- internalHasNodeState(NodeId id)

This has the effect that ItemStates that reflect node type definitions are not accessible directly with their uuid.
