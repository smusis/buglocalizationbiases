bad assumptions/error handling in SetValueVersionExceptionTest:



Description:
SetValueVersionExceptionTest makes several assumptions that may not be true in all repositories:

- nodes can be created without specifying a node type
- nodes are not referenceable by default (thus addMixin fails)

Also, if a repository does not allow creating a reference property, the associated test should be aborted with NotExecutableException.
