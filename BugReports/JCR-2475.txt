Test failures when running "mvn cobertura:check"



Description:
It looks like the bytecode instrumentation done by Cobertura interferes with the rather complex XPathTokenManager class produced by JavaCC.

The easiest workaround seems to be to simply exclude XPathTokenManager from being instrumented by Cobertura.
