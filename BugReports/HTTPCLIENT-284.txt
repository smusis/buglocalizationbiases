Updates to connectionStaleCheckingEnabled docs.



Description:
Comments from Itai Brickner:

In the Threading section of the UserGuide
(
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/threading.html
)

There is no mentioning of the
'setConnectionStaleCheckingEnabled'
I also felt that it wasn't clear from the APIDOC
(http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/apidocs/org/apache/commons/httpclient/MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.html)
that staleCheckingEnabled will cause a stale
connection to be reconnected by the
MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager

thanks,

Itai
