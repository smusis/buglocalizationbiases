Http Authentication with invalid credentials causes infinite loop



Description:
At HttpMethodBase(460), a break statement is executed only if
log.isInfoEnabled(). The break statement needs to be moved outside of the if
statement so that it breaks if realms already contains foo. Patch submitted on
mailing list as per Apache site guidelines.
