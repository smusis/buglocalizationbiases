Add OSGi bundle metadata to manifest



Description:
See this discussion on the Felix mailing list:
http://www.mail-archive.com/felix-dev@incubator.apache.org/msg04041.html

If there is an easy way to generate the information required for an OSGi bundle into the manifest of our distributable JAR, we should do it.
The runtime and API are not affected, it is only a modification of the build process.
I'll follow up on this when I have information about the required tooling.

cheers,
  Roland
