Enabling wire logging changes isEof/isStale behavior



Description:
If you enable wire logging, DefaultClientConnection wraps the SocketInputBuffer with a LoggingSessionInputBuffer. This hides the EofSensor interface implemented by SocketInputBuffer (but not LoggingSessionInputBuffer), which makes at least AbstractHttpClientConnection.isEof() and isStale() methods behave differently.

(That is, stale connection checks won't really work as intended if wire logging is enabled. Which makes it a bit difficult to debug problems related to stale connections...)

Proposed fix: implement EofSensor interface in LoggingSessionInputBuffer (delegating it to wrapped buffer).
