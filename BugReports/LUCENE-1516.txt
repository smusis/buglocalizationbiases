Integrate IndexReader with IndexWriter 



Description:
The current problem is an IndexReader and IndexWriter cannot be open
at the same time and perform updates as they both require a write
lock to the index. While methods such as IW.deleteDocuments enables
deleting from IW, methods such as IR.deleteDocument(int doc) and
norms updating are not available from IW. This limits the
capabilities of performing updates to the index dynamically or in
realtime without closing the IW and opening an IR, deleting or
updating norms, flushing, then opening the IW again, a process which
can be detrimental to realtime updates. 

This patch will expose an IndexWriter.getReader method that returns
the currently flushed state of the index as a class that implements
IndexReader. The new IR implementation will differ from existing IR
implementations such as MultiSegmentReader in that flushing will
synchronize updates with IW in part by sharing the write lock. All
methods of IR will be usable including reopen and clone.
