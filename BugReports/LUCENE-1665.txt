Remove SortField.AUTO



Description:
I'd like to remove SortField.AUTO... it's dangerous for Lucene to
guess the type of your field, based on the first term it encounters.
It can easily be wrong, and, whether it's wrong or right could
suddenly change as you index different documents.

It unexepctedly binds SortField to needing an IndexReader to do the
guessing.

It's caused various problems in the past (most recently, for me on
LUCENE-1656) as we fix other issues/make improvements.

I'd prefer that users of Lucene's field sort be explicit about the
type that Lucene should cast the field to.  Someday, if we have
optional strong[er] typing of Lucene's fields, such type information
would already be known.  But in the meantime, I think users should be
explicit.
