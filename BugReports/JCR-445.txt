repository is locked by WorkspaceJanitor when another workspace is reindexing



Description:
when the searchindex is corrupt or missing, it is rebuilt lazily after initialization of a workspace. usually by the first login on that workspace. during this time, the workspaceinfo is locked. unfortunately, the workspace janitor locks the repository and checks all workspace infos, if they can be disposed. in this case, no other access to the repository can be performed until the searchindex is initialized (which can take some time).

T1 -> WS1.login -> WS initializing
Janitor -> lock repo -> scan -> try lock WS1
T2 -> WS2.login -> must wait for T1
