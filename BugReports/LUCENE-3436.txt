Spellchecker "Suggest Mode" Support



Description:
This is a spin-off from SOLR-2585.

Currently o.a.l.s.s.SpellChecker and o.a.l.s.s.DirectSpellChecker support two "Suggest Modes":
1. Suggest for terms that are not in the index.
2. Suggest "more popular" terms.

This issue is to add a third Suggest Mode:
3. Suggest always.

This will assist users in developing context-sensitive spell suggestions and/or did-you-mean suggestions.  See SOLR-2585 for a full discussion.

Note that o.a.l.s.s.SpellChecker already can support this functionality, if the user passes in a NULL term & IndexReader.  This, however, is not intutive.  o.a.l.s.s.DirectSpellChecker currently has no support for this third Suggest Mode.
