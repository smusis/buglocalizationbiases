Add Searcher.search(Query, int)



Description:
Now that we've deprecated Hits (LUCENE-1290), I think we should add this trivial convenience method to Searcher, which is just sugar for Searcher.search(Query, null, int) ie null filter, returning a TopDocs.

This way there is a simple API for users to retrieve the top N results for a Query.
