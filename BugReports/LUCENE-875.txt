javadocs creation has too many warnings/errors



Description:
Currently running 'ant javadocs' creates so many warnings that you have to grep the output to verify that new code did not add more.

While most current errors might be minor, they might hide a few serious ones that we will never know abut until someone complains. 

Best if we fix all of them and keep it always clean...
