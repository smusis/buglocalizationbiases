improved internal representation of DATE values



Description:
DATE values are currently internally represented as java.util.Calendar objects.

Calendar objects have a huge memory footprint (approx 200bytes per instance) 
and are mutable.

i suggest to replace the internal DATE representation with a ISO8601 format string
(immutable and approx. 85-90% smaller footprint).
