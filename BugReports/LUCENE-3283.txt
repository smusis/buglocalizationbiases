Move core QueryParsers to queryparser module



Description:
Move the contents of lucene/src/java/org/apache/lucene/queryParser to the queryparser module.

To differentiate these parsers from the others, they are going to be placed a 'classic' package.  We'll rename QueryParser to ClassicQueryParser as well.
