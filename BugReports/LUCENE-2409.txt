add a tokenfilter for icu transforms



Description:
I pulled the ICUTransformFilter out of LUCENE-1488 and create an issue for it here.

This is a tokenfilter that applies an ICU Transliterator, which is a context-sensitive way
to transform text. 

These are typically rule-based and you can use ones included with ICU (such as Traditional-Simplified)
or you can make your own from your own set of rules.
