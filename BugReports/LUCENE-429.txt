Little improvement for SimpleHTMLEncoder



Description:
The SimpleHTMLEncoder could be improved slightly: all characters with code >=
128 should be encoded as character entities. The reason is, that the encoder
does not know the encoding that is used for the response. Therefore it is safer
to encode all characters beyond ASCII as character entities.

Here is the necessary modification of SimpleHTMLEncoder:

       default:
         if (c < 128) {
           result.append(c);
         } else {
           result.append("&#").append((int)c).append(";");
         }
