Node merge method doesnt seems to recurse thru childs of the right source node



Description:
I checked the NodeImpl.merge(...)

it seems the way it process the childs nodes is wrong
as it calls the merge on the childs of the src node that come from the source workspace.
plus in the case srcNode is null it would end on a NullPointerException as

it does  NodeIterator ni = srcNode.getNodes(); in the second statment of the if condition
