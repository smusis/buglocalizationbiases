Real In-memory Repository



Description:
For unit tests it is desirable to have an in-memory repository which holds its whole data(even PropertyType.BINARY) in memory.
The actual implementation of org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.mem.InMemPersistenceManager uses the FileSystemBLOBStore along with LocalFileSystem.
The binary properties are serialized to the OS-Filesystem.
