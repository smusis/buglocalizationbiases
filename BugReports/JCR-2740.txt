On missing child node, automatically remove the entry (when a session attribute is set)



Description:
If a node points to a non-existing child node (which is a repository inconsistency), currently this child node is silently ignored for read operations (as far as I can tell). However, when trying to add another child node with the same name, an exception is thrown with a message saying a child node with this name already exists. Also, the parent node can't be removed.

One solution is to remove the bad child node entry, but only if the session attribute "org.apache.jackrabbit.autoFixCorruptions" is set (so by default the repository is not changed 'secretly'):

    SimpleCredentials cred = new SimpleCredentials(...);
    cred.setAttribute("org.apache.jackrabbit.autoFixCorruptions", "true");
    rep.login(cred);

It's not a perfect solution, but it might be better than throwing an exception and basically preventing changes.

Another solution (not implemented) would be to rename the missing child node entry when trying to add a child node with the same name (for example add the current date/time, or a random digit until there is no conflict), and then continue with adding the new child node.
