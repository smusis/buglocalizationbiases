JSR 283 lifecycle management



Description:
JSR 283 specifies a simple lifecycle management mechanism for nodes, and as the reference implementation we should implement that feature. We also need to implement the related TCK tests.

This feature introduces a few new API methods, but during Jackrabbit 1.x we can just introduce them as custom jsr-283 API extensions.
