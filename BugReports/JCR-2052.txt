XPath QueryFormat may produce malformed XPath statement



Description:
When the query tree contains select properties *and* an order by clause, then the XPath QueryFormat will produce a malformed XPath statement.

E.g.:

//element(*, foo)/(@a|@b) order by @bar

round trips to:

//element(*, foo) order by @bar/(@a|@b)
