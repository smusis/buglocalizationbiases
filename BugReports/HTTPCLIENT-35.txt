[HttpClient] Better proxy support in HttpMultiClient



Description:
If proxy requires authentication, it sends status 407 (Proxy Authentication 
Required) and the response header "Proxy-Authenticate" (see RFC2616; e.g. Squid 
can be configured to do so).
HttpClient doesn't yet process this response.
Behavior should be similar to processing of status 401 (Unauthorized).
