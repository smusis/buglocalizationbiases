SSL contrib files do not use standard javax.net.ssl package provided from JDK 1.4.2



Description:
Hi all,

While trying to use ssl on AIX, i found that some of the files contributed in 
src/contrib/org/apache/commons/httpclient/contrib/ssl were making hard 
references to com.sun.net.ssl package. Since JDK 1.4.2, one shall use the 
javax.net.ssl package instead.

I have then:
1/ fixed the source files appropriately
2/ updated the build.xml to also build a commons-http-client-contrib.jar 

I will attached to this bug report the resulting unified diff to include in svn
