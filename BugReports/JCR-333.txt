NodeTypeDef depends on supertype ordering



Description:
Currently the NodeTypeDef.setSupertypes() method simply sets the given QName array as the supertype QName array of the defined node type, thus preserving whatever ordering a node type parser or ultimately a node type definition file uses. This causes problems for example in the equals() method that uses the order-sensitive Arrays.equals() method to check for equality of the supertype QName arrays. The current implementation does therefore not consider the node type definitions "A > B, C" and "A > C, B" as equal even though they really should be so considered.

The same problem affects also child node and property definitions. The proper fix for this issue would probably be to use Sets to store and handle this information.
