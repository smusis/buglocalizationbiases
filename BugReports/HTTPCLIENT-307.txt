An IOException or RuntimeException leaves the underlying socket in an undetermined state



Description:
If an application level IOException or RuntimeException occurs, the underlying
socket will be in an undetermined state. In many cases, this will lead to zombie
connections in the pool that do not respond properly.

Simple example: uploading a file via POST. If we promise the server 1MB of data.
Shortly after starting the transfer an IOException occurs (e.g. the NFS server
the file was residing on stops responding). The connection is returned to the
pool (see HTTPCLIENT-302) but the the server is still expecting close to 1MB of data
on that socket. The next request on that socket (e.g. a GET) will send the HTTP
header but  the server thinks the header is part of the old stream and doesn't
respond.
