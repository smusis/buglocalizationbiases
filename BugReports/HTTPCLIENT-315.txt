HttpURL creates wrong authority String when user info is changed



Description:
When changing the user info on an existing HttpURL which has additional port
information, the new authority String contains a wrong hostname part: instead of
getting "hostname:portnumber" the string is "hostnameportnumber", i.e. the ":"
is missing.
Methods which needs to be changed are:

setRawPassword(...)
setRawUser(...)
setRawUserinfo(...)

(look for the line
String hostport = (_port == -1) ? hostname : hostname + _port;
)
