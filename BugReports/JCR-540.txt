AbstractJCRTest fails on level 1 repositories



Description:
If a test case indicates that it's not read-only, org.apache.jackrabbit.test.AbstractJCRTest tries to cleanup the test root in the setUp method. This will cause the test case to fail, because a Level 1 repository will throw an UnsupportedOperationException here.

Proposal: before trying the cleanup, check for L2 functionality and throw a NotExecutableException otherwise:

            if (! isSupported(Repository.LEVEL_2_SUPPORTED)) {
              cleanUp();
              String msg = "Test case requires level 2 functionality";
              throw new NotExecutableException(msg);
            }
