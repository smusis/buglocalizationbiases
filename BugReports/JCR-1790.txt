terminology: source uses "protected  property" for something that only only indirectly has to do with that term



Description:
Documentation and method names (DavProperty) use "protected" as pseudonym for "return upon PROPFIND/allprop". This isn't really accurate, because the live properties defined in RFC2518/4918 *are* protected, but are returned with PROPFIND/allprop nevertheless.

Proposal: update documentation and method names to say something like "visibleInAllprop".
