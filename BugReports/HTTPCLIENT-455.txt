Feature Request: include contributed code for Plugin Proxy Detection



Description:
Attached is a zip file containing two classes - PluginProxyUtil and
ProxyDetectionException.  I've tested
PluginProxyUtil.detectProxy(URL) on Windows XP(JRE's 1.3/1.4/1.5 with IE) and
Solaris (JRE 1.4 with Netscape)
and it correctly detects browser plugin settings.  I don't have access to MacOS
X  to try it, but I doubt that
it works there anyway based on Dmitri's comments here:

Please change the header and package as necessary to include it in the contrib
section.  I plan to contribute
an example Applet that uses this code at some point - our app is way too
complicated to use as an example.
If you want to wait until that is done to include it, that's fine too.  Just
wanted to offer this up now in case
anyone else is looking for it.
