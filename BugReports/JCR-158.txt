TextFilterService uses Sun specific classes



Description:
The TextFilterService uses the Sun specific and actually undocumented class sun.misc.Service class to lookup TextFilter implementations. This approach will not work on all JVM implementations.

The Service should rather use javax.imageio.spi.ServiceRegistry, which is part of the standard J2SE API.
