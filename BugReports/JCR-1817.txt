Core: Misleading method naming with Workspace and Session (move283, copy283, clone283)



Description:
there seems to be leftovers from previous drafts of the jsr 283 within jackrabbit core, namely:

- WorkspaceImpl#clone283
- WorkspaceImpl#copy283
- WorkspaceImpl#move283
- SessionImpl#move283

giving the impression that with jsr 283 those method would return 'String'. this however is not the case.
therefore i suggest to remove those methods again.
