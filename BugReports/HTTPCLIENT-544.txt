Digest auth uses incorrect URI



Description:
This bug seems to be strongly related to #36918. But in this case, I don't have 
proxy and it is GET method.

The problem is that when a GET request with query parameters is sent to the 
server, uri does not count in the parameters.  The server (Apache 1.3) then 
responds with HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request. In the error log, the server writes:  
Digest: uri mismatch - </query.cgi> does not match request-uri 
</query.cgi?format=advanced&js=1&rememberjs=1>

As far as I can tell, the problem is with the following line of code:
------------ cut DigestScheme.java
public String authenticate(Credentials credentials, HttpMethod method)
....
getParameters().put("uri", method.getPath());
....
------------ cut

I am inclined to quick-hack this and add method.getQueryString() to the uri; 
but to make it right it probably needs some refactoring, esp. considering issue 
#36918.
