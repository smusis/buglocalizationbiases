If setConfig(Config config) is called in resetInputs(), you can turn term vectors off and on by round



Description:
I want to be able to run one benchmark that tests things using term vectors and not using term vectors.

Currently this is not easy because you cannot specify term vectors per round.

While you do have to create a new index per round, this automation is preferable to me in comparison to running two separate tests.

If it doesn't affect anything else, it would be great to have setConfig(Config config) called in BasicDocMaker.resetInputs(). This would keep the term vector options up to date per round if you reset.
