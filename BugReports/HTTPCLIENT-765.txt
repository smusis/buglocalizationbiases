String.toLowerCase() / toUpperCase() should specify Locale.ENGLISH



Description:
There are quite a few instances of String.toLowerCase() - and some of toUpperCase() - method calls which don't specify the Locale.

These should probably mostly/all use Locale.ENGLISH, otherwise there may be problems in some Locales.
e.g. Turkey, where "i".toUpperCase() is not equal to "I" - and vice-versa.

The isSpecialDomain() method in NetscapeDomainHandler is one instance where the code won't always work in Turkey.
