Small improvements to ArrayUtil.getNextSize



Description:
Spinoff from java-dev thread "Dynamic array reallocation algorithms" started on Jan 12, 2010.

Here's what I did:

  * Keep the +3 for small sizes

  * Added 2nd arg = number of bytes per element.

  * Round up to 4 or 8 byte boundary (if it's 32 or 64 bit JRE respectively)

  * Still grow by 1/8th

  * If 0 is passed in, return 0 back

I also had to remove some asserts in tests that were checking the actual values returned by this method -- I don't think we should test that (it's an impl. detail).
