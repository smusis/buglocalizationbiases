Query Builder and jcr:deref problem. Can't add predicate after jcr:deref



Description:
Cannot add a predicate (like [@property = 'value'] after a jcr:deref function.
The query builder throws an "InvalidQueryException: Unsupported location for jcr:deref()".

So for example, the query :

//element(*,nt:category)[@member]/jcr:deref(@member, '*')[@property='value'] 

is invalid and it should be valid.
