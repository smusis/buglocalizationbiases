add checks/asserts if you search across a closed reader



Description:
if you try to search across a closed reader (and/or searcher too),
there are no checks, not even assertions statements.

this results in crazy scary stacktraces deep inside places like FSTs/various term dictionary implementations etc.

In some situations, depending on codec, you wont even get an error (i'm sure its fun when you try to retrieve the stored fields!)
