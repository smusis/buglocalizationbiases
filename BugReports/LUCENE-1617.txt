Add "testpackage" to common-build.xml



Description:
One can define "testcase" to execute just one test class, which is convenient. However, I didn't notice any equivalent for testing a whole package. I find it convenient to be able to test packages rather than test cases because often it is not so clear which test class to run.

Following patch allows one to "ant test -Dtestpackage=search" (for example) and run all tests under the \*/search/\* packages in core, contrib and tags, or do "ant test-core -Dtestpackage=search" and execute similarly just for core, or do "ant test-core -Dtestpacakge=lucene/search/function" and run all the tests under \*/lucene/search/function/\* (just in case there is another o.a.l.something.search.function package out there which we want to exclude.
