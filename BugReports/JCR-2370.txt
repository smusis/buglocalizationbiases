Index recovery may fail when redo log contains nodes that are part of an index aggregate



Description:
SearchIndex.mergeAggregatedNodeIndexes() will throw a NullPointerException because index is not yet set. The call is made from the recovery code that is triggered in the MultiIndex constructor.
