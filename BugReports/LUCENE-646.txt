[PATCH] fix various small issues with the "getting started" demo pages



Description:

This patch contains numerous small fixes for the "getting started"
pages on the Lucene Java web site.  Here are the rough fixes:

  * To results.jsp:

    - changed StopAnalyzer -> StandardAnalyzer

    - changed references of "url" to "path" (field "url" is never set
      and was therefore always null)

    - remove prefix of "../webapps" from path so clicking through works

  * Fixed typos, grammar and other cosmetic things.

  * Modernized some things that have changed with time (names of JAR
    files, which languages have analyzers, etc.)

  * Added outbound links to Javadocs, Wiki, Lucene static web site,
    external sites, when appropriate.

  * Removed exact version of Tomcat for the demo web app (I think all
    recent versions of Tomcat will work as described)

  * Other small changes...

Net/net I think this is an improved version of what's available on the
site today.
