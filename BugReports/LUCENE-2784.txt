Change all FilteredTermsEnum impls into TermsEnum decorators



Description:
Currently, FilteredTermsEnum has two ctors:
* FilteredTermsEnum(IndexReader reader, String field)
* FilteredTermsEnum(TermsEnum tenum)

But most of our concrete implementations (e.g. TermsRangeEnum) use the IndexReader+field ctor

In my opinion we should remove this ctor, and switch over all FilteredTermsEnum implementations to just take a TermsEnum.

Advantages:
* This simplifies FilteredTermsEnum and its subclasses, where they are more decorator-like (perhaps in the future we could compose them)
* Removes silly checks such as if (tenum == null) in every next()
* Allows for consumers to pass in enumerators however they want: e.g. its their responsibility if they want to use MultiFields or not, it shouldnt be buried in FilteredTermsEnum.

I created a quick patch (all core+contrib+solr tests pass), but i think this opens up more possibilities for refactoring improvements that haven't yet been done in the patch: we should explore these too.
