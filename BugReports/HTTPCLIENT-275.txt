problem with isIPv4address() for relative uri's



Description:
the following block of code:

try {
	URI uri = new URI("http://10.0.1.10:8830");
	System.out.println("is IP="+uri. isIPv4address());
	uri = new URI(uri, "/04-1.html");
	System.out.println("is IP="+uri. isIPv4address());
} catch (URIException e) { ; }

returns the output:

is IP=true
is IP=false

so by being created from a relative uri URI objects don't have the right setting of  isIPv4address().
