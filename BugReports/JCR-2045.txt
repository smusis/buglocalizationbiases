Jcr-Server: missing-auth-mapping init parameter should have option for GuestCredential login



Description:
the missing-auth-mapping parameter of the servlets contained in jcr-server is defined as follows:

             <param-value>anonymous:anonymous</param-value>
             <description>
                 Defines how a missing authorization header should be handled.
                 1) If this init-param is missing, a 401 response is generated.
                    This is suiteable for clients (eg. webdav clients) for which
                    sending a proper authorization header is not possible if the
                    server never sent a 401.
                 2) If this init-param is present with an empty value,
                    null-credentials are returned, thus forcing an null login
                    on the repository.
                 3) If this init-param has a 'user:password' value, the respective
                    simple credentials are generated.
             </description>

JCR 2.0 introduces GuestCredentials used to obtain a "anonymous" session.

Therefore we should probably extend/modify the missing-auth-param in a way that
allows to distinguish between

- null-login
- guest login

in case of missing authorization header.
