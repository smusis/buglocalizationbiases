Observation events are not triggered for intermediate nodes in version storage



Description:
When a new version history is created no observation events are triggered for the intermediate nodes.

E.g. for the VersionHistory d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8 the following events are triggered (with a node filter applied, property events are not visible):

Node added: /jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/d9/4d/4b/d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8
Node added: /jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/d9/4d/4b/d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8/jcr:versionLabels
Node added: /jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/d9/4d/4b/d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8/jcr:rootVersion
Node added: /jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/d9/4d/4b/d94d4b41-f68e-4586-9e88-96e6790981d8/jcr:rootVersion/jcr:frozenNode

Observation should also trigger node added events for:
/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/d9
/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/d9/4d
/jcr:system/jcr:versionStorage/d9/4d/4b
