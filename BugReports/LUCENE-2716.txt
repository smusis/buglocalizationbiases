Improve automaton's MinimizeOperations.minimizeHopcroft() to not create so many objects



Description:
MinimizeOperations.minimizeHopcroft() creates a lot of objects because of strange arrays and useless ArrayLists with fixed length. E.g. it created List<List<List<>>>. This patch minimizes this and makes the whole method much more GC friendler by using simple arrays or avoiding empty LinkedLists at all (inside reverse array). 

minimize() is called very very often, especially in tests (MockAnalyzer).

A test for the method is prepared by Robert, we found a bug somewhere else in automaton, so this is pending until his issue and fix arrives.
