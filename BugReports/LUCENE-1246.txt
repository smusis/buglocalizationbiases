Missing a null check in BooleanQuery.toString(String)



Description:
Our queryParser/tokenizer in some situations creates null query and was added as a clause to Boolean query.
When we try to log the query, NPE is thrown from log(booleanQuery).

In BooleanQuery.toString(String), a simple null check is overlooked.
