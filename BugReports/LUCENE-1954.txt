InitiatedIndex: CCE on casting NumericField to Field



Description:
An unchecked cast to List<Field> throws a ClassCastException when applied to, for example, a NumericField.
Appearently, this has been fixed trunk, but for a 2.9.1 release, this could be helpful.
The patch can be applied against the 2.9.0 tag.
