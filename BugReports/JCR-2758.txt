Session.save() potentially causes endless loop when READ permission is denied on root node



Description:
if the current session doesn't have read permission on the root node, calling Session.save() triggers a call to SessionItemStateManager.getIdOfRootTransientNodeState()
in order to find the root of the minimal subtree including all transient states. this might cause an endless loop, depending on the transient changes.
