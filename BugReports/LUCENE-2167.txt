Implement StandardTokenizer with the UAX#29 Standard



Description:
It would be really nice for StandardTokenizer to adhere straight to the standard as much as we can with jflex. Then its name would actually make sense.

Such a transition would involve renaming the old StandardTokenizer to EuropeanTokenizer, as its javadoc claims:

bq. This should be a good tokenizer for most European-language documents

The new StandardTokenizer could then say

bq. This should be a good tokenizer for most languages.

All the english/euro-centric stuff like the acronym/company/apostrophe stuff can stay with that EuropeanTokenizer, and it could be used by the european analyzers.
