Refactoring of the Persistence Managers



Description:
currently the persistence managers reside in:
 org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state
 org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.db
 org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.mem
 org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.obj
 org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.xml
 (org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.util)

there are also a lot of other classes that deal with states (eg:
SharedItemStateManager) in the state package that do not relate to
pms.

i would like to move all persistencemanagers and pm related stuff to:

 org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence

I'd keep the current classes as deprecated subclasses within
jackrabbit-core.jar until Jackrabbit 2.0. There may (?) be people who
are extending the existing classes, so I'd avoid breaking binary
compatibility there even though we've never promised to actually honor
compatiblity within o.a.j.core.
