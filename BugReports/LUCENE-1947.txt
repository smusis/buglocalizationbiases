Snowball package contains BSD licensed code with ASL header



Description:
All classes in org.tartarus.snowball (but not in org.tartarus.snowball.ext) has for some reason been given an ASL header. These classes are licensed with BSD. Thus the ASL header should be removed. I suppose this a misstake or possible due to the ASL header automation tool.
