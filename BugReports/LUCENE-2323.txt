reorganize contrib modules



Description:
it would be nice to reorganize contrib modules, so that they are bundled together by functionality.

For example:
* the wikipedia contrib is a tokenizer, i think really belongs in contrib/analyzers
* there are two highlighters, i think could be one highlighters package.
* there are many queryparsers and queries in different places in contrib
