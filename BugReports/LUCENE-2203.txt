improved snowball testing



Description:
Snowball project has test vocabulary files for each language in their svn repository, along with expected output.

We should use these tests to ensure all languages are working correctly, and it might be helpful in the future for identifying back breaks/changes if we ever want to upgrade snowball, etc.
