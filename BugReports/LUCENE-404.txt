Crash when querying an index using multiple term positions.



Description:
file: MultipleTermPositions.java, line: 201, function: skipTo(int).

This refers to the source that can currently be downloaded from the lucene site,
Lucene v. 1.4.3.

The function peek() returns null (because top() also retruned null). There is no
check for this, as far as I can understand. The function doc() is called on a
null-object, which results in a NullPointerException.

I switched the specified line to this one:

while(_termPositionsQueue.peek() != null && target >
_termPositionsQueue.peek().doc())

This got rid of the crash for me.
