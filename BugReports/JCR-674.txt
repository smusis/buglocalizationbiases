String properties with invalid XML characters export as invalid XML



Description:
As noted in the current JCR 1.0.1 maintenance draft, sections 6.4.1,
6.4.2.6, XML export of string properties that contain invalid XML
characters isn't well-defined currently, since those characters are
not permissible in XML.  The proposed fix is to use base64
encoding for such values in System View.

Most characters below #x20 are examples of this.  Currently, these
are escaped numerically in output (such as (amp)#0; )  but
such escape sequences can't be parsed by the XML
import methods.

The current behavior is particularly problematic, because the user
doesn't know the output is corrupt until later, when they try to import it
and get InvalidSerializedDataException.

If for some reason the base64 option is delayed, it might
make sense, as an interim solution, to fail on export
or to somehow patch import to relax its parsing and allow
these escape codes.
