allow cache to be configured as a non-shared (private) cache



Description:
Currently the CachingHttpClient only behaves as a shared cache, which is a safe and conservative assumption. However, in some settings, it would be appropriate to be able to configure the CachingHttpClient as a non-shared cache, which would make more responses cacheable, including:
* responses to requests with Authorization headers
* responses with 'Cache-Control: private'
* ability to serve stale responses when invalidation fails for 'Cache-Control: proxy-revalidate'
