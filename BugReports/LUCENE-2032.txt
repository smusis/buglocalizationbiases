Spatial Filters not Serializable



Description:
I am using Lucene in a distributed setup. 

The Filters in the spatial project aren't Serializable even though it inherits it from Filter. Filter is a Serializable class. 

DistanceFilter contains the non-Serializable class WeakHashMap.
CartesianShapeFilter contains the non-Serializable class java.util.logging.Logger
