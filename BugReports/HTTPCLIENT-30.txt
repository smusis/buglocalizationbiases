should allow receiving secure cookies from non-secure chanel



Description:
Currently, httpclient will throw an exception if a secure cookie is received 
from a non-secure chanel. Although RFC doesn't specify explicitly on if the 
client should allow receiving secure cookie from non-secure channel, the 
default setting in browser seems to allow it.

Try the following link in IE:

http://www.snapfish.com

The default cookie policy in httpclient should be the same.
