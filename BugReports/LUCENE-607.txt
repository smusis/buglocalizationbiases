ParallelTermEnum is BROKEN



Description:
ParallelTermEnum.next() fails to advance properly to new fields.  This is a serious bug. 

Christian Kohlschuetter diagnosed this as the root problem underlying LUCENE-398 and posted a first patch there.

I've addressed a couple issues in the patch (close skipped field TermEnum's, generate field iterator only once, integrated Christian's test case as a Lucene test) and packaged in all the revised patch here.

All Lucene tests pass, and I've further tested in this in my app, which makes extensive use of ParallelReader.
