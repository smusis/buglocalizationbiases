codec postings api (finishDoc) is inconsistent



Description:
finishDoc says:

{noformat}
  /** Called when we are done adding positions & payloads
   *  for each doc.  Not called  when the field omits term
   *  freq and positions. */
   public abstract void finishDoc() throws IOException;
{noformat}

But this is confusing (because a field can omit just positions, is it called then?!),
and wrong (because merging calls it always, even if freq+positions is omitted).

I think we should fix the javadoc and fix FreqProxTermsWriter to always call finish()
