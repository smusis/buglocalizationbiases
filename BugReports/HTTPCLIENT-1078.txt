DecompressingEntity not calling close on InputStream retrieved by getContent



Description:
The method DecompressingEntity.writeTo(OutputStream outstream) does not close the InputStream retrieved by getContent().
According to the documentation of HttpEntity.writeTo:
IMPORTANT: Please note all entity implementations must ensure that
all allocated resources are properly deallocated when this method
returns.

-> imho this is not satisfied in DecompressingEntity.writeTo
