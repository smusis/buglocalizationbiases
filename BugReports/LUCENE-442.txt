TestIndexModifier.testIndexWithThreads is not valid?



Description:
I recently started playing with the trunk of SVN, and noticed that intermitently, TestIndexModifier.testIndexWithThreads (revision 292010) would fail.

The basic premise of the test seems to be that 3 pairs of IndexThread instances can be started in parallel, each pair using the same instance of IndexModifier to concurrently and randomly add/delete/optimize a single FSDirectory index.  
The test is considered a success if the sum of additions-deletions recorded by each pair of threads equals the final docCount() for the IndexModifier instance used by that pair of threads.

Now I freely admit that I'm not 100% familiar with the code for IndexModifier, but at a glance, the basic premise seems to be: 
   a) If method for IndexWriter is called, open it if needed, close the IndexReader first if needed.
   b) if method for IndexReader is called, open it if needed, close the IndexWriter first if needed.

If I'm understnading that correctly, I see no reason to assume this test will pass.  
It seems like there could be plenty of scenerios in which the number of additions-deletions != docCount(). The most trivial example I can think of is:
   1) the first IndexThread instance which has a chance to run adds a document, and optimizes before any other IndexThreads ever open the Directory.
   2) a subsequent pair of IndexThread instances open their IndexModifier instance before any documents are deleted.
   3) the IndexThread instances from #2 do nothing but add documents
...that pair of IndexThreads is now garunteed to have recorded a differnet number of additions then the docCount returned by their IndexModifier.

Am I missing something, or should this test be removed?
