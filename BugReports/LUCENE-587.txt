Explanation.toHtml outputs invalid HTML



Description:
If you want an HTML representation of an Explanation, you might call the toHtml() method.  However, the output of this method looks like the following:

<ul>
  <li>some value = some description</li>
  <ul>
    <li>some nested value = some description</li>
  </ul>
</ul>

As it is illegal in HTML to nest a UL directly inside a UL, this method will always output unparseable HTML if there are nested explanations.

What Lucene probably means to output is the following, which is valid HTML:

<ul>
  <li>some value = some description
    <ul>
      <li>some nested value = some description</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
