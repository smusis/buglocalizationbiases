Various small improvements to contrib/benchmark



Description:
I've worked out a few small improvements to contrib/benchmark:

  * Refactored the common code in Open/CreateIndexTask that sets the
    configuration for the IndexWriter.  This also fixes a bug in
    OpenIndexTasks that prevented you from disabling flushing by RAM.

  * Added a new config property for LineDocMaker:

      doc.reuse.fields=true|false

    which turns on/off reusing of Field/Document by LineDocMaker.
    This lets us measure performance impact of sharing Field/Document
    vs not, and also turn it off when necessary (eg if you have your
    own consumer that uses private threads).

  * Added merge.scheduler & merge.policy config options.

  * Added param for OptimizeTask, which expects an int and calls
    optimize(maxNumSegments) with that param.

  * Added param for CloseIndex(true|false) -- if you pass false that
    means close the index, aborting any running merges
