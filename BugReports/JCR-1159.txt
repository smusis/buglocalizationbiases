SPI: improve description of locking methods on RepositoryService



Description:
in detail:

1) getLockInfo

- intended behavior if no lock is present?
- intended behavior if locking is not supported?

2) lock

- currently InvalidItemStateException is listed. i don't think this make too much sense.

3) refreshLock

- intended behavior if locking is not supported?

4) unlock

- currently InvalidItemStateException is listed. i don't think this make too much sense.
