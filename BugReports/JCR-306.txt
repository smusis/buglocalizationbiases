repositoryConfig should use setter for its internal components

I refactored the config classes last year but didn't change the way
the config instances are being used by Jackrabbit. In general I think
that a IoC approach (use setters to configure the Jackrabbit
components) would be better than passing config objects around and
letting the components to instantiate any subcomponents based on the
configuration. This is why I didn't really want to make the config
constructors public, otherwise we'd easily up with backwards
compatibility issues if we were to change the way configuration is
handled.
