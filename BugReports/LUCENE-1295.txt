Make retrieveTerms(int docNum) public in MoreLikeThis



Description:
It would be useful if 
{code}
private PriorityQueue retrieveTerms(int docNum) throws IOException {
{code}

were public, since it is similar in use to 
{code}
public PriorityQueue retrieveTerms(Reader r) throws IOException {
{code}

It also seems useful to add 
{code}
public String [] retrieveInterestingTerms(int docNum) throws IOException{
{code}
to mirror the one that works on Reader.
