MultiThreadedConnectionManager should provide a shutdown



Description:
MultiThreadedConnectionManager should provide a shutdown() method to release 
all its resources, it is currently using daemon threads that cannot be stopped 
and HTTP connections that cannot be released.
This is annoying when the pool of connection is created within a web 
application that is undeployed and re-deployed (i.e. the JVM is not restarted) 
consuming resources on local and remote servers.
