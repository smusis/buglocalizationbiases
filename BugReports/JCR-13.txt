Disable SearchManager



Description:
In previous versions (e.g. SVN tag 0.1-spec0.14) it was possible to disable the SearchManagers by not configuring a search index path. In the current revision, a NullPointerException is thrown, if the search index configuration is missing, tough the rest of the system would support missing search index configuration as before.

I suggest to extend search index configuration interpretation in WorkspaceCfg.init as follows:

        Element srchConfig = wspElem.getChild(SEARCH_INDEX_ELEMENT);
        if (srchConfig != null) {
            String pathAttr = srchConfig.getAttributeValue(PATH_ATTRIB);
            if (pathAttr != null && pathAttr.length() > 0) {
                searchIndexDir = replaceVars(pathAttr, vars);
            }
        }

This only reads search index configuration if available.

The reason to switch of the SearchManager is, that in my use case enabling the SearchManager yields a performance degradation of a factor of 10 ! Instead of taking around 500ms (which is still too long :-) to save 3 nodes and 15 properties, it would take around 5 seconds to save the same amount of data. And I do not need the SearchManager in my use case.
