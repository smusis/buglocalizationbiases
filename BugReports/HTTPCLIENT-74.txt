J2EE FORM authentication (also affects pluggable authentication)



Description:
Add support for J2EE style FORM authentication type. 

Unlike the BASIC and DIGEST types this is not handled by HTTP headers so needs
an adjustment to the way in which the authentication is sent. As far as i can
tell from my testing with one or two J2EE servers the way to successfully login
requires request of a protected page which will respond with the login FORM and
then the submission of that form. The two requests must be associated with one
another using the jsessionid cookie.

It seems to me that this 'bug' must be solved in cooperation with the recent
discussions of pluggable authentication module. i suggestion the following
signature: 

PluggableAuthenticator.authenticate(HttpMethod method, HttpState state). 

This mirrors the existing Authenticator method but also requires change to the
state object to allow access to the connection properties (i dont know how this
affects MultiClient). Alternately we could go for: 

PluggableAuthenticator.authenticate(HttpMethod method, HttpClient client).

In either case Authenticator needs a way to know which plugin to call. I suggest
modification of HttpMethodBase to detect the 'j_security_check' form action in
the response and automatically submit credentials if they are provided using the
new class 

J2EEFormAuthenticator implements PluggableAuthenticator.
