CompactNodeTypeDefReader adds nt:base as declared supertype even if already extending



Description:
(reported to the list by michael singer)

I wrote a simple program which uses the nt-ns-util contribution to
register custom node types written in CND language.

I defined the following (very simple) custom node types:

<test = 'http://foo.bar/test'>
[test:firstnodetype]
+ test:secondnodetype mandatory

<test = 'http://foo.bar/test'>
[test:secondnodetype] > test:firstnodetype
+ test:thirdnodetype

<test = 'http://foo.bar/test'>
[test:thirdnodetype] > test:secondnodetype
- test:catalog (string)  < 'URI', 'URN', 'DOI', 'ISBN', 'ISSN'
- test:entry (string) m


In the resulting custom_nodetypes.xml each of the custom nodes has a
supertype of "nt:base" but I didn't explicitely define a supertype of
"nt:base" for [test:secondnodetype] and [test:thirdnodetype].

I think this behavior is wrong since the method getDeclaredSupertypes()
of class NodeType always returns "nt:base" plus the explicitely declared
Supertype (which it e.g. does not for "nt:folder").
