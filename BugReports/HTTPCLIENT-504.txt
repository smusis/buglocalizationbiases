max connections per host setting does not work



Description:
When using the MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager the default maximal
connections per host/port cannot be exceeded (allowed maximum is 2 by default).
Attempts to exceed this by manually setting the max connections using
HttpConnectionManagerParams#setMaxConnectionsPerHost fail. This is caused by a
bug in the MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.
