DavMethodBase#getResponseException fails if the body is not (valid) XML



Description:
I have a set up that uses the JCR Webdav Server from a custom remote client.
I've noticed one thing, anytime I request a node that doesn't exist the error that comes back from the server is as follows:

[Fatal Error] :1:941: The element type "HR" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</HR>".
javax.jcr.RepositoryException: The element type "HR" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</HR>".: The element type "HR" must be terminated by the matching end-tag "</HR>".

Doesn't really make sense, but that is OK, I can handle that.

My problem:
I have a partially populated repository that at the root has a few nodes like
/edu/....
/com/ibm/..

So, I want to create a few nodes of type nt:folder under

com/myCompany/folder1

I have no problem creating them, but since "com" already exists I end up with
com[2]/myCompany/folder1.

So, I went ahead and used the parentNode.hasNode("folderName") method.

This method returns true for the "com" portion, but when I test for the "myCompany" folder which should return false I get the error response shown above from the server.

The webdav request looks as follows:
PROPFIND /jackrabbit/server/default/jcr%3aroot/com/myCompany

The snippet of code looks as follows:
  private Node createFolders (Session session, Node parentNode, List <String> folders)
	  throws RepositoryException {
    Node folderNode = null;
    for (String folder : folders) {
	if (parentNode.hasNode(folder))
	    folderNode = parentNode.getNode(folder);
	else
	    folderNode = parentNode.addNode(folder, "nt:folder");
	parentNode = folderNode;
    }
    session.save();
    return (folderNode);
  }
