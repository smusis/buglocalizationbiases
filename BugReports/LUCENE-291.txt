[PATCH] FSDirectory create() method deletes all files



Description:
hi all,

the current implementation of FSDirectory.create(...) silently deletes all files
(even empty directories) within the index directory when setting up a new index
with create option enabled. Lucene doesn't care when deleting files in the index
directory if they  belong to lucene or not. I don't think that this is a real
bug, but it can be a pain if somebody whants to store some private information
in the lucene index directory, e.g some configuration files.

Therefore i implemented a FileFilter which knows about the internal lucene file
extensions, so that all other files would never get touched when creating a new
index. The current patch is an enhancement in FSDirectory only. I don't think
that there is a need to make it available in the Directory class and change all
it's depending classes.

regards
Bernhard
