Tablespace (Filegroup) support for MS SQL Server



Description:
Tablespace support was added for Oracle database servers in this issue

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-968

We would like tablespace (or filegroup) support for MS SQL Server as well. To address this, we have created a patch using the trunk of JackRabbit that closely follows the patch in the above named issue.
