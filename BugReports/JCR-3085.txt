better diagnostics when version storage is broken



Description:
In InternalVersionManagerBase, the code doesn't do a null-check on the predecessors property, assuming it'll always be present. When this is not the case due to a repository problem, we'll see a NPE.

Proposal: add code that generates a more meaningful error message; making it easier to debug in production.
