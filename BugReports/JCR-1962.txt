web.xml refers to 2.2 dtd



Description:
the web.xml present in the jackrabbit-webapp project contains the following doctype:

<!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN" "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/web-app_2_2.dtd">

what is probably meant is

<!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN" "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">

since the dependency also points to version 2.3 of the servlet-api

if nobody objects, i will adjust it accordingly.
