consolidate FieldCache and ExtendedFieldCache instances



Description:
It's confusing and error prone having two instances of FieldCache... FieldCache .DEFAULT and ExtendedFieldCache .EXT_DEFAULT.
Accidentally use the wrong one and you silently double the memory usage for that field.  Since ExtendedFieldCache extends FieldCache, there's no reason not to share the same instance across both.
