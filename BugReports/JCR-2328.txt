PropertyValue constraint fails with implicit selectorName using JCR-SQL2



Description:
Compiling a JCR-SQL2 query involving a PropertyValue constraint using a qualified property name fails if selectorName is not explicitly defined.

The following query works:

SELECT * FROM [my:thing] AS thing WHERE thing.[my:property] = 'abc'

the following doesn't:

SELECT * FROM [my:thing] AS thing WHERE [my:property] = 'abc'

(the "AS thing" is unecessary here, I can leave it out with the same result).

The second query results in an:
javax.jcr.query.InvalidQueryException: Query:
SELECT * FROM [my:thing] AS thing WHERE [(*)my:property] = 'abc';
expected: NOT, (

The spec final draft however states:

PropertyValue ::= [selectorName'.'] propertyName
   /* If only one selector exists in this query,
      explicit specification of the selectorName is
      optional */
