[PATCH] disable coord for generated BooleanQueries



Description:
Here's a patch that disables Similiarty.coord() in the scoring of most
automatically generated boolean queries.  The coord() score factor is
appropriate when clauses are independently specified by a user, but is usually
not appropriate when clauses are generated automatically, e.g., by a fuzzy,
wildcard or range query.  Matches on such automatically generated queries are
currently penalized for not matching all terms.
