Split up IndexInput and IndexOutput into DataInput and DataOutput



Description:
I'd like to introduce the two new classes DataInput and DataOutput
that contain all methods from IndexInput and IndexOutput that actually
decode or encode data, such as readByte()/writeByte(),
readVInt()/writeVInt().

Methods like getFilePointer(), seek(), close(), etc., which are not
related to data encoding, but to files as input/output source stay in
IndexInput/IndexOutput.

This patch also changes ByteSliceReader/ByteSliceWriter to extend
DataInput/DataOutput. Previously ByteSliceReader implemented the
methods that stay in IndexInput by throwing RuntimeExceptions.

See also LUCENE-2125.

All tests pass.
