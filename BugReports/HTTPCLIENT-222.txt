Via NTLM proxy to SSL Apache/BasicAuth. - worked in may 22nd, but broken in beta1



Description:
Hi there,

This morning I downloaded beta 1 and tried a small piece of code to connect to 
a SSLified apache server (using basic authentication) via a MS-Proxy 2.0 with 
NTLM enabled. The sourcecode of my crashme is based on the 1st attachment for 
HTTPCLIENT-153. It differs from the original in using basic authentication for the 
webserver instead of NTLM.

It failed with this error:

--
10-jun-2003 16:39:05 org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase 
processAuthenticationResponse
INFO: Already tried to authenticate to "website#" but still receiving 407.
Status: 407 : Proxy authentication required
--

Then I downloaded a fresh night build (commons-httpclient-20030605) which also 
failed :/

Then I went back to an old build from May (commons-httpclient-20030522) which 
worked like a charm!!!

Using MSIE I can succesfully connect to the apache server. I know it's not a 
problem with typos because I have MSIE ask me for all creds.

Seems somethings got broken along the way. If I can help, please ask!

Cheers.
