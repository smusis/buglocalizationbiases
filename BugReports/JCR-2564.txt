SQL2 query: QOMFormatter create incorrect NOT conditions



Description:
Then the following query is parsed:
SELECT test.* FROM test WHERE (NOT test.name = 'Hello') AND test.id = 3
then the SQL statement generated, it becomes:
SELECT test.* FROM test WHERE NOT test.name = 'Hello' AND test.id = 3
which is parsed differently and becomes:
SELECT test.* FROM test WHERE NOT (test.name = 'Hello' AND test.id = 3)
