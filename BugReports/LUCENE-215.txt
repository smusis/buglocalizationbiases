addIndexes unexpectedly closes index



Description:
It seems that in 1.4rc2, a call to IndexWriter.addIndexes (IndexReader[]) will
close the provided IndexReader; in 1.3-final this does not happen.  So my code
which uses addIndexes to merge new information into an index and then calls
close() on the IndexReader now crashes with an "already closed" exception.  I
can attach test code which works in 1.3 but not in 1.4rc2 if that would be helpful.

If this is an intentional change in behavior, it needs to be documented.  Thanks!
