RMI-DateValue does not support full ISO8601 format



Description:
as mentioned in the javadoc:

 * To convert <code>Calendar</code> instances to and from strings, this class
 * uses a <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> instance with the pattern
 * <code>yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'</code>. The issue with this pattern is that
 * the era specification as defined in the JCR specification (+/- prefix) as
 * well as full time zone naming are not supported.
