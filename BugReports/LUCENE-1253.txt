LengthFilter and other TokenFilters that skip tokens ignore relative positionIncrement



Description:
See for reference:
http://www.nabble.com/WordDelimiterFilter%2BLenghtFilter-results-in-termPosition%3D%3D-1-td16306788.html
and http://www.nabble.com/Lucene---Java-f24284.html

It seems that LengthFilter (at least) could produce a stream in which the first Token has a positionIncrement of 0, which make CheckIndex and Luke function "Reconstruct&Edit" to generate exception.

Should something be done to avoid this situation, or could the error be ignored (by allowing Term with a position of -1, and relaxing CheckIndex checks?)
