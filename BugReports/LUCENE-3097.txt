Post grouping faceting



Description:
This issues focuses on implementing post grouping faceting.
* How to handle multivalued fields. What field value to show with the facet.
* Where the facet counts should be based on
** Facet counts can be based on the normal documents. Ungrouped counts. 
** Facet counts can be based on the groups. Grouped counts.
** Facet counts can be based on the combination of group value and facet value. Matrix counts.   

And properly more implementation options.

The first two methods are implemented in the SOLR-236 patch. For the first option it calculates a DocSet based on the individual documents from the query result. For the second option it calculates a DocSet for all the most relevant documents of a group. Once the DocSet is computed the FacetComponent and StatsComponent use one the DocSet to create facets and statistics.  

This last one is a bit more complex. I think it is best explained with an example. Lets say we search on travel offers:
|||hotel||departure_airport||duration||
|Hotel a|AMS|5
|Hotel a|DUS|10
|Hotel b|AMS|5
|Hotel b|AMS|10

If we group by hotel and have a facet for airport. Most end users expect (according to my experience off course) the following airport facet:
AMS: 2
DUS: 1

The above result can't be achieved by the first two methods. You either get counts AMS:3 and DUS:1 or 1 for both airports.
