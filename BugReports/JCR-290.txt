NodeTypeRegistry.registerNodeType(NodeTypeDef) does not verify that the referenced namespaces are registered



Description:
currently it's possible to register a node type using a defintion that contains references to unregistered namespaces.

using such a  node type in content would lead to unpredictable results.
