WebDAV: pack AbstractWebdavServlet with the jackrabbit-webdav project



Description:
suggestion posted by alan cabrera on the dev list:

"Quite a handy servlet.  Too bad it's in jackrabbit-server.  Would this not be better placed in jackrabbit-webdav?  I'm writing my own server bits under WEBDAV and would prefer not to have JCR/Jackrabbit stuff.  I realize that this is a fussy preference."
