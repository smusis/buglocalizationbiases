o.a.l.messages should be moved to core



Description:
contrib/queryParser contains an org.apache.lucene.messages package containing some generallized code that (claims in it's javadocs) is not specific to the queryParser.

If this is truely general purpose code, it should probably be moved out of hte queryParser contrib -- either into it's own contrib, or into the core (it's very small)

*EDIT:* alternate suggestion to rename package to fall under the o.a.l.queryParser namespace retracted due to comments in favor of (eventually) promoting to it's own contrib
