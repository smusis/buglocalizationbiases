SSLSocketFactory.createSSLContext does not process trust store



Description:
org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory.createSSLContext() does not process a provided trust store.
Only the default (cacerts) is processed. An additional provided trust store is ignored.
Adding the "trusted" certificate to the keystore, the peer is authenticated.

Eventually
        tmfactory.init(keystore);
needs to be
        tmfactory.init(truststore);
