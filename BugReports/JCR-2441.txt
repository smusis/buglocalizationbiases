Jcr2spiRepositoryFactory: make class loading more robust



Description:
Currently Jcr2spiRepositoryFactory loads a RepositoryServiceFactory from the context class loader. In an OSGi environment this fails with a ClassNotFoundException. I suggest to fall back to the class loader of a the class (Jcr2spiRepositoryFactory) in this case.
