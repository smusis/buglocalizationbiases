Jackrabbit web page scroll is slow with Firefox



Description:
When I visit http://jackrabbit.apache.org/ from my Firefox in Ubuntu  the browser scroll is very slow and make CPU go to 100%. 

The problem seems to be the "fixed" attribute in the css background definition, so it should be removed.

body {
  background:white url(bg.png) repeat-x fixed center bottom;
  font-family:Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;
  font-size:small;
  margin:0pt;
  padding:0pt;
}
