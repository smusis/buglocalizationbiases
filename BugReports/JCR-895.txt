Registering node type names with spaces fails in clustered environment



Description:
Registering a node type name that contains at least one space in a clustered environment will cause a JournalException in cluster nodes trying to read that change back from the journal. The stack trace observed is:

JournalException: Parse error while reading node type definition.
       at AbstractRecord.readNodeTypeDef(AbstractRecord.java:245)
       ...
Caused by: ParseException: Missing '[' delimiter for beginning of node type name ((internal), line 47)
       at Lexer.fail(Lexer.java:148)
       ...
