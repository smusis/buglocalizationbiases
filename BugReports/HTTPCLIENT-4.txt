Chunked transfer encoding not isolated from application.



Description:
Chunked transfer encoding is not being supported transparently by the
HttpMethodBase object, causing chunk data to be embedded in response body data
and forcing the application to handle the HTTP/1.1 implementation of chunked
transfer encoding.

The included patch now properly parses chunk data as per RFC 2068 and provides
body content consistently, regardless of whether chunked transfer encoding was
used by the server or not. This relieves the application from the requirement of
implementing RFC 2068.

Patch sent to mailing list as per guidelines to address this deficiency.
