Update namespace uri for prefix fn



Description:
The SearchManager class still uses an outdated namespace uri for the 'fn' prefix: http://www.w3.org/2004/10/xpath-functions

The prefix should be re-mapped to the now offical namespace: http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions

See: http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-operators/#namespace-prefixes

To keep a minimum of backward compatibility, the existing namespace uri should still exist in the namespace registry, but refer to another prefix. E.g. fn_old.
