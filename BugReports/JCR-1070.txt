Promotion of SPI from Contrib



Description:
This has been suggested by Jukka on the dev-list [1] and i would like to start the promotion now. Apart from 
the promotion itself the discussion regarding distribution of common classes [2] and the related issue JCR-996 somehow depends on the promotion and i consider the latter one to be important to follow.

So far nobody objected the promotion. If this is still true, i will start working on that.
