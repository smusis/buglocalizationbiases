Introduce Timer idle time



Description:
Currently the Timer stops the internal thread as soon as there are no more tasks scheduled. With a usage pattern that repeatedly schedules tasks and immediately cancels them, one thread per scheduled task is created. There should be some idle time before the background thread is stopped.
