Polish Analyzer



Description:
Andrzej Bialecki has written a Polish stemmer and provided stemming tables for it under Apache License.

You can read more about it here: http://www.getopt.org/stempel/

In reality, the stemmer is general code and we could use it for more languages too perhaps.
