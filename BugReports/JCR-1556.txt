PersistenceManager API change breaks backward compatibility



Description:
Persistence Manager API change introduced in JCR-1428 breaks backward compatibility. although this is not a public visible API it renders 3rd party PMs invalid that do not extend from AbstractPersistenceManager.
at least for the 1.4.3 patch release, we should not do this.

suggest to revert the API change for the next 1.4.4 release, but leave the method on the abstract pm, and introduce it only for 1.5.
