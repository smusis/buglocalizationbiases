Host configuration properties not updated when the method is redirected



Description:
the above uri:

http://www.adobe.com/cgi-bin/redirect?http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xsl-fo

generates two 302 responses:

from the original to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xsl-fo
and from that to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xsl-fo/

the client accepts and follows these redirects (a trace of the process shows it's working well) but when 
you ask the getmethod what uri we ended up at using the getURI() method it returns the bastardised 
result:

http://www.adobe.com/Archives/Public/www-xsl-fo/

instead of the correct 

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-xsl-fo/

that the client has actually downloaded.
