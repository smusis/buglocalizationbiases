Add possibility to disable automatic authentication header processing.



Description:
In the application I'm working on I need the possibility to manually get the 
WWW-Authenticate header instead of letting the HttpClient process it 
automatically. Instead of rewriting the execute() method in a subclass I added 
a configuration setting, similar to the followRedirects flag. Diffs below for 
anyone interested.
