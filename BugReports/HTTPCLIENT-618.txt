Eliminate class HostConfiguration



Description:
Remove the target host attribute from the HostConfiguration class. This will allow one HostConfiguration object to be used for different targets.
The problem is that currently MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager uses HostConfiguration objects as cache keys, which needs to be changed.

This is a followup to HTTPCLIENT-615.
