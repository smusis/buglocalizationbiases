Customizable Cookie Policy



Description:
Even if the server is not complying with the cookie specification, sometimes 
you still need to talk to it.

It would be nice that when setting the Cookie Policy for the HttpMethod, you 
could specify a custom policy that implements the CookieSpecBase but may 
handle certain problems more leniently.  This would be instead of specifying 
one of the three hard-coded policies.
