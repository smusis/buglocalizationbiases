Make MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager defaults public statics.



Description:
Could the defaults for MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager be made public
constants? I would do it my self since I have karma as a contributer to [lang]
and [codec] but I do not want to step on anyones toes. ;-)

Patch attached.
