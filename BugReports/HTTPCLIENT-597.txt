Hello,

I made two changes to the HttpClient code:

1) in the class ConnectionPool in the method getFreeConnection( ... ) I
changed freeConnections.removeFirst() to freeConnections.removeLast(). Now
the container for free connections behaves as a stack rather than a queue.

2) additionally I changed the IdleConnectionTimeoutThread, in the run()
method I added connectionManager.deleteClosedConnections() so that the pool
size is maintained correctly.

What do you think?
Balazs
