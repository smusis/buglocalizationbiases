Enable setting the terms index divisor used by IndexWriter whenever it opens internal readers



Description:
Opening a place holder issue... if all the refactoring being discussed don't make this possible, then we should add a setting to IWC to do so.

Apps with very large numbers of unique terms must set the terms index divisor to control RAM usage.

(NOTE: flex's RAM terms dict index RAM usage is more efficient, so this will help such apps).

But, when IW resolves deletes internally it always uses default 1 terms index divisor, and the app cannot change that.  Though one workaround is to call getReader(termInfosIndexDivisor) which will pool the reader with the right divisor.
