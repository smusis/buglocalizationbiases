Provide support for unconnected sockets



Description:
Overview description:
If Proxy settings are incorrect or host does not reply, the
HttpClient.executeMethod() hangs, and HttpMethod.abort() does not stop it. Thus,
you cannot assert that the entire application will stop immediately on demand.

Expected Results:
During a HttpMethod.executeMethod(), HttpMethod.abort() should cancel
immediately the executeMethod().

Actual Results:
If HttpMethod.executeMethod() freezes because of Proxy bad settings or not
responding hostname (in fact impossible to open the socket), the abort() method
does not do anything.

Platform:
I tested it on Windows XP and Linux Debian with HttpClient 3.0 RC2 (but if you
look further I point the problem and the source code of the nightly build is
identical).

See comments for the dialogue about the problem, and 2 Test cases. The solution
is described at the end, but it may implies a change in the API and works only
since Java 1.4.
