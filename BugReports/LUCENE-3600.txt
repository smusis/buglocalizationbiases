BlockJoinQuery advance fails on an assert in case of a single parent with child segment



Description:
The BlockJoinQuery will fail on an assert when advance in called on a segment with a single parent with a child. The call to parentBits.prevSetBit(parentTarget - 1) will cause -1 to be returned, and the assert will fail, though its valid. Just removing the assert fixes the problem, since nextDoc will handle it properly.

Also, I don't understand the "assert parentTarget != 0;", with a comment of each parent must have one child. There isn't really a reason to add this constraint, as far as I can tell..., just call nextDoc in this case, no?
