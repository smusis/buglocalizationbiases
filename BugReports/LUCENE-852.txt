spellchecker: make hard-coded values configurable



Description:
the class org.apache.lucene.search.spell.SpellChecker uses the following hard-coded values in its method
indexDictionary:
        writer.setMergeFactor(300);
        writer.setMaxBufferedDocs(150);
this poses problems when the spellcheck index is created on systems with certain limits, i.e. in unix
environments where the ulimit settings are restricted for the user (http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47428#47428).

there are several ways to circumvent this:
1. add another indexDictionary method with additional parameters:
    public void indexDictionary (Dictionary dict, int mergeFactor, int maxBufferedDocs) throws IOException
    
2. add setter methods for mergeFactor and maxBufferedDocs 
    (see code in http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47428#47428 )

3. Make SpellChecker subclassing easier as suggested by Chris Hostetter 
   (see reply  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/47463#47463)

thanx,
