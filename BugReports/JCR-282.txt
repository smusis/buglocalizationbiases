JCR-Server: respect maximal value for timeout



Description:
RFC 2518 states:

"The timeout value for TimeType "Second" MUST NOT be greater than 2^32-1."

->> adjust constant according.

BTW: sending 'Infinite' timeout in case of maximal value causes problems with microsoft builtin client, that will never unlock that resource.
