Configure the maven build for IDE project generation for IDEA and Eclipse



Description:
Can we add a plugin configuration for the maven-idea-plugin and maven-eclipse-plugin, with JDK version set for IDEA and configured source download of dependencies?

Simplifies project regeneration and working with IDEA or Eclipse.

I'll add a patch.

Thanks!
