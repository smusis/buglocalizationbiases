IndexWriter.updateDocument is no longer atomic



Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-847.

Ning caught that as of LUCENE-843, we lost the atomicity of the delete
+ add in IndexWriter.updateDocument.

Ning suggested a simple fix: move the buffered deletes into
DocumentsWriter and let it do the delete + add atomically.  This has a
nice side effect of also consolidating the "time to flush" logic in
DocumentsWriter.
