jcr-server: make auth-header configurable for JCR-Server



Description:
In WEB-INF/web.xml, there is a section (commented-out by default) that reads:
        <init-param>
            <param-name>authenticate-header</param-name>
            <param-value>Basic realm="Jackrabbit Webdav Server"</param-value>
            <description>
                Defines the value of the 'WWW-Authenticate' header.
            </description>
        </init-param>

This parameter is ignored (not loaded) by the code - the default string is always used instead
Note: this was more of a problem before JCR-286 had been fixed
