IndexWriter.close(false) does not actually stop background merge threads



Description:
Right now when you close(false), IndexWriter marks any running merges
as aborted but then does not wait for these merges to finish.  This
can cause problems because those threads still hold files open, so,
someone might think they can call close(false) and then (say) delete
all files from that directory, which would fail on Windows.

Instead, close(false) should notify each running merge that it has
been aborted, and not return until all running merges are done.  Then,
SegmentMerger should periodically check whether it has been aborted
and stop if so.
