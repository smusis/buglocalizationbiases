Digest auth uses wrong uri in proxy authentication



Description:
I'm having a problem getting httpclient-rc1 to authenticate using
digest to our IAS server.  I've tried upgrading to rc3 without any
effect.  I also got our IT guys to upgrade IAS without luck.  I was
also able to have the GET method work under IAS and CONNECT to work
with a couple other proxy servers.  After examining ethereal logs for
my (commons) code and firefox to the same URLs I noticed that the
value for the "uri" setting in the "Proxy-Authorization" header was
the only significant difference.  After looking at RFC 2617 I noticed
that in section 3.2.2 (The Authorization Request Header) it states:

digest-uri
The URI from Request-URI of the Request-Line; duplicated here because
proxies are allowed to change the Request-Line in transit.

A re-examination of the headers showed that firefox was matching the Request-URI
with the digest-uri but that httpclient was not.  I reproduced partial headers
below.  I tried modifying the RC3 source to produce a hard-coded value for "uri"
and demonstrated that it would successfully authenticate to that URI.  I also
checked that authentication would fail to any other URI and it did.
