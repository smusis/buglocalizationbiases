303 Redirects are not handled properly



Description:
When the server spits back a 303 (See Other), the redirect is not handled. 
Looking at the code, I saw that the processRedirectResponse method in
HttpMethodBase does not check for SC_SEE_OTHER in the case statement. 
SC_SEE_OTHER is a redirect and should be handled appropriately.

Here is a trace from the output of the client and server.
