Download: improve user experience



Description:
The download section at http://jackrabbit.apache.org/downloads.html
contains many files. The number of files should be reduced.

Some of them contain other files, for example the .rar files, and the .war files. 
The file jackrabbit-jca-1.4.rar  contains an old version of jackrabbit-core:
jackrabbit-core-1.4.jar - however the newest version of jackrabbit-core is 
jackrabbit-core-1.4.5.jar

This often leads to problems.
