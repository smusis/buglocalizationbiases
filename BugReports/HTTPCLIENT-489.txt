Request is retried if preemptive authentication fails



Description:
Hello,

I'm using premptive authentification from an Axis client using BASIC Http
authentification. When the user isn't authenticated/authorized by server (in my
case, credentials are expired), httpclient runs a "Chalenge" that produces a
second request to server with same credentials.

when using preemptive mode, chalenge should be skipped if authentication scheme
hasn't changed !
