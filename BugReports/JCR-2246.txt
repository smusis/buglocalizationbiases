Deprecate/remove unused FileSystem features such as RandomAccessOutputStream



Description:
Currently the FileSystem interface includes a method getRandomAccessOutputStream.
It looks like this method and the class RandomAccessOutputStream is no longer used.
If this is the case, I suggest we remove the method everywhere and deprecate the class.
