Support updateDocument() with DWPTs



Description:
With separate DocumentsWriterPerThreads (DWPT) it can currently happen that the delete part of an updateDocument() is flushed and committed separately from the corresponding new document.

We need to make sure that updateDocument() is always an atomic operation from a IW.commit() and IW.getReader() perspective.  See LUCENE-2324 for more details.
