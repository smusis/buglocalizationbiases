LuceneTestCase.afterClass does not print enough information if a temp-test-dir fails to delete



Description:
I've hit an exception from LTC.afterClass when _TestUtil.rmDir failed (on write.lock, as if some test did not release resources). However, I had no idea which test caused that (i.e. opened the temp directory and did not release resources).

I think we should do the following:
* Track in LTC a map from dirName -> StackTraceElement
* In afterClass if _TestUtil.rmDir fails, print the STE of that particular dir, so we know where was this directory created from
* Make tempDirs private and create accessor method, so that we control the inserts to this map (today the Set is updated by LTC, _TestUtils and TestBackwards !)
