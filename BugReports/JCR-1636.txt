Make shutdown hooks in TransientFileFactory removable



Description:
TransientFileFactory class always registers shutdown hook. So, if jackrabbit classes were loaded by web-app classloader, they will not be released when web-app is undeployed (if jackrabbit-jcr-commons JAR is inside WAR). This causes classloader leak.
It seems to be useful to have ability to cancel TransientFileFactory's shutdown hook when application is going to be unloaded to avoid classloader leak.
