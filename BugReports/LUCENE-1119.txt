Optimize TermInfosWriter.add



Description:
I found one more optimization, in how terms are written in
TermInfosWriter.  Previously, each term required a new Term() and a
new String().  Looking at the cpu time (using YourKit), I could see
this was adding a non-trivial cost to flush() when indexing Wikipedia.

I changed TermInfosWriter.add to accept char[] directly, instead.

I ran a quick test building first 200K docs of Wikipedia.  With this
fix it took 231.31 sec (best of 3) and without the fix it took 236.05
sec (best of 3) = ~2% speedup.
