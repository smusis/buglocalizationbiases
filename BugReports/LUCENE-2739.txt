Refactor TestIndexWriter



Description:
TestIndexWriter is getting a bit unwieldy:
* 5,315 lines of code
* 116 test methods
* runtimes frequently between 1 and 2 minutes.

It starts to be pretty scary to merge changes because its so massive.

A lot of the tests arguably belong somewhere else (e.g. the addIndex* tests belong in TestAddIndexes)

But here is a start:
# Pulls out the *OnDiskFull tests into TestIndexWriterOnDiskFull
# Pulls out the multithreaded tests into TestIndexWriterWithThreads
