removing properties through SPI: two ways to do it



Description:
Batch currently provides two ways to delete a property, similarly to JCR:

- Batch.remove()
- Batch.setValue(..., null)

JCR2SPI currently uses (AFAIK) Batch.remove().

Proposal:

- clarify that the QValue argument in setValue must be non-null (same for setValues)
