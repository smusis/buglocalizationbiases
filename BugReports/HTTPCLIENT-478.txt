HttpConnectionParams.setConnectionTimeout(int) has no effect if host unreachable



Description:
I have just modified MultiThreadedExample.java by adding
httpClient.getHttpConnectionManager().getParams().setConnectionTimeout(5000); in
order to set a connection timeout on the client side. Then I have added a LAN
url to urisToGet array. The ip of this url ("http://192.168.254.1/") is not
assigned to any computer.

After running the client, I get the expected message ( error:
org.apache.commons.httpclient.ConnectTimeoutException: The host did not accept
the connection within timeout of 5000 ms) but only after 20 seconds.

I use java version "1.5.0_04". This is not a JVM bug since normal connection
procedure times out after 5 seconds as expected:
        SocketAddress addr = new InetSocketAddress("192.168.254.1", 80);
        try {
            
            SocketChannel channel = SocketChannel.open();
            channel.socket().connect(addr, 5000);            
            System.out.println("connected");
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
