Add a document describing the HttpClient release process



Description:
The commons release process (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/releases.html) is
a good starting place, but is out of date.  When we do our own releases, there
are some other steps particular to maven, the test-local and the webapp tests
that must be documented.
