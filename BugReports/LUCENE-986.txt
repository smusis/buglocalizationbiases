Refactor segmentInfos from IndexReader into its subclasses



Description:
References to segmentInfos in IndexReader cause different kinds of problems
for subclasses of IndexReader, like e. g. MultiReader.

Only subclasses of IndexReader that own the index directory, namely 
SegmentReader and MultiSegmentReader, should have a SegmentInfos object
and be able to access it.

A part of the refactoring work was already done in LUCENE-781
