Repository is corrupt after concurrent changes with the same session



Description:
After concurrent write operations using the same session, the repository can get corrupt, meaning a ItemNotFoundException is thrown when trying to remove a node.

Concurrent write operations are not supported, however I believe the persistent state of the repository should not be get corrupt.

One way to solve this problem is to synchronize on the session internally.
