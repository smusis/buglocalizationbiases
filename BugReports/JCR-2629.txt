LoginModuleConfig should allow to specify principalProvider-name in addition to the class



Description:
Gilles Metz reported this issue regarding login module configuration with Day's CRX based on Jackrabbit, which in
previous versions allowed to specify multiple prinicpal providers of the same class but with different configurations.
With JR 2.0 and 2.1 this is not supported as the pp class name is used as key in the registry and does not allow
to specify a separate key/name.
