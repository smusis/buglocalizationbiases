workspace.copy does not copy binary properties properly



Description:
Workspace copy works fine for everything else but if you copy a hierarchy which contains binary properties
and remove the source after copying it removes the binary from "copied" newly created hierarchy as well.

How to reproduce:

1. create hierarchy with any type of nodes  - /site / en / image [Type Binary]
2. create another hierarchy at different level - /site2
3. copy /site/en under /site2
-- till now everything is fine, its a proper copy and if you export xml out of these 2 hierarchies you will see that "image" is actually copied
4. now delete /site/en
5. you will see all other properties as copied before /site2/en... except binary.

are binary types are always referenced? even if you copy via workspace copy
