Move MemoryJournal from test to main



Description:
Running our tests with the FileJournal implementation on a windows box can be quite slow because of the many FileDescriptor.sync() calls.

I'd like to move the MemoryJournal in jackrabbit-core test to the main sources. That way we can use it in other test setups.
