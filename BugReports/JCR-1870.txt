jcr2spi: reloading of invalidated nodes doesn't benefit from batch-read



Description:
issue reported by stefan:

upon reloading of an invalidated node, jcr2spi doesn't use batch-read but only retrieves the NodeInfo.

basically, WorkspaceItemStateFactory ll 92 needs to be changed to omit the extra handling of 
invalidated node entries and always use RepositoryService.getItemInfos when build the NodeState.

i will try it out as soon as possible.
