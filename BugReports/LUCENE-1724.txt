Analysis package calls Java 1.5 API



Description:
I found compile errors when I tried to compile trunk with 1.4 JVM.
org.apache.lucene.analysis.NormalizeCharMap
org.apache.lucene.analysis.MappingCharFilter

uses Character.valueOf() which has been added in 1.5.
I added a CharacterCache (+ testcase) with a valueOf method as a replacement for that quite useful method.

org.apache.lucene.analysis.BaseTokenTestCase

uses StringBuilder instead of the synchronized version StringBuffer (available in 1.4)

I will attach a patch shortly.
