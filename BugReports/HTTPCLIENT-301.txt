Cookie rejected



Description:
Hello,

I'm using HttpClient 1.0 rc2 to login in the SourceForge website and perform
some operations, but i'm getting the following error:

Page 1 from https://sourceforge.net/account/login.php
6 dÃ©c. 2003 23:45:27 org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase
processResponseHeaders
ATTENTION: Cookie rejected: "username=l6qpwtK5hpE%3D". Illegal domain attribute
".sourceforge.net". Domain of origin: "sourceforge.net"
6 dÃ©c. 2003 23:45:27 org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase readResponseBody

The cookie returned by Sourceforge is rejected because the domain for the
request was sourceforge.net and the domain for the cookie was .sourceforge.net
I have tried to change the cookie policy to all available options, but none work. 
CookiePolicy.setDefaultPolicy(CookiePolicy.COMPATIBILITY);

What can i do?

Thanks,
Ludovic
