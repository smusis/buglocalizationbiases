use the internal CND file for builtin nodetypes



Description:
the jackrabbit node type registry is reading the built in node types from a XML file.
since the CND (compact node type definition notation) is now specified by jsr283,
i would like to drop the builtin .xml file and read the builtin node typesonly from the .cnd file.
this certainly helps the developers. furthermore, all the node types in jsr283 are now speced
in CND, and converting them to XML is a pain and error prone.
