search.function - (1) score based on field value, (2) simple score customizability



Description:
FunctionQuery can return a score based on a field's value or on it's ordinal value.

FunctionFactory subclasses define the details of the function.  There is currently a LinearFloatFunction (a line specified by slope and intercept).

Field values are typically obtained from FieldValueSourceFactory.  Implementations include FloatFieldSource, IntFieldSource, and OrdFieldSource.
