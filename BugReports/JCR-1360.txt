Parsing built-in CND and XML nodetypes does not result in equal nt-definitions



Description:
i created a test in order to make sure builtin-nodetypes.xml and builtin-nodetypes.cnd provide the same definitions (actually i only wanted to test my own changes).

it reveals that the existing built-in NodeTypeDefinitions are not equal due to the following reason:

- in the xml-format nt:base is always specified if no other super type extends from nt:base
- in the cnd notation the nt:base is omitted (see below for quote from appendix of jsr 283) even if other super type(s) are
  defined and none of them extends from nt:base.

this affects the following nodetypes (all extending from mix:referenceable only):

nt:versionHistory
nt:version
nt:frozenNode
nt:resource


quote from public-review of jsr 283:

"7.2.2.4 Supertypes [...]
After the node type name comes the optional list of supertypes. If this element is not present and the node type is not a mixin (see 7.2.2.5 Options), then a supertype of nt:base is assumed."


I'm not totally sure, if according to the quote above the built-in cnd-definitions are valid at all. since it states, that the nt:base is assumed if no other super type is defined. In the case of the node types above, mix:referenceable is defined to be the only super type, which is not totally true... the non-mixin types are always sub types of nt:base.

In either case: From my understanding the node types resulting from parsing the xml and the cnd file should be equal.
If the definitions are valid, we may need to adjust the CompactNodeTypeDefReader.
