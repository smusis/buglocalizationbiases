Test class in the main source tree



Description:
org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TestRepository is in the main source folder
(src/main/java) instead of the test folder (src/test/java).

The build of jackrabbit-core is successful even if I move the class
to the test folder, so it looks like it was just a mistake.
