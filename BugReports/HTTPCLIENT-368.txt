[PATCH]character encoding handling is invalid at multipart



Description:
Hi,

Commons-Httpclient handle character encoding incorrect at multipart. This is 
significant problem for other than English people like me. Multipart has two 
encoding. First is header encoding which specify header of each part. Second 
is it's body encoding. Body encoding works well but header encoding is fixed 
as 'asc-ii'. This problem user following situation.

* upload file which file name is described by other than "asc-ii".
* use parameter which include other than "asc-ii" character.

Unfortunately , It seems RFC doesn't define header encoding for multipart but 
a lot of people needs set header encoding for thier own laungage. I attached
the patch. Please fix this problem.

regards,

Takashi Okamoto
