Cut over SpanQuery#getSpans to AtomicReaderContext



Description:
Followup from LUCENE-2831 - SpanQuery#getSpans(IR) seems to be the last remaining artifact that doesn't enforce per-segments context while it should really work on AtomicReaderContext (SpanQuery#getSpans(AtomicReaderContext) instead of a naked IR.
