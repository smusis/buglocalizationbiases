Versioning fixup leaves persistence in a state where the node can't be made versionable again



Description:
Jackrabbit's version recovery mode (org.apache.jackrabbit.version.recovery system property) disconnects all version histories that expose problems that manifest in unexpected exceptions being thrown. "disconnects" means removing the properties defined for mix:versionable and removing the mixin type. The actual versioning related nodes remain in place.

The problem: when re-adding mix:versionable, ItemSaveOperation.initVersionHistories tries to create the new version history in the same location (the path being derived from the versionable node's identifier), and consequently fails because of the broken underlying storage.

(attaching a work-in-progress test case that illustrates the problem)
