FieldCache rewrite method for MultiTermQueries



Description:
For some MultiTermQueries, like RangeQuery we have a FieldCacheRangeFilter etc (in this case its particularly optimized).

But in the general case, since LUCENE-2784 we can now have a rewrite method to rewrite any MultiTermQuery 
using the FieldCache, because MultiTermQuery's getEnum no longer takes IndexReader but Terms, and all the 
FilteredTermsEnums are now just real TermsEnum decorators.

In cases like low frequency queries this is actually slower (I think this has been shown for numeric ranges before too),
but for the really high-frequency cases like especially ugly wildcards, regexes, fuzzies, etc, this can be several times faster 
using the FieldCache instead, since all the terms are in RAM and automaton can blast through them quicker.
