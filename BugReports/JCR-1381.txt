Path is not indexed when inserting a new node with SNS



Description:
Using Jackrabbit OCM, when inserting two nodes with the same path, the second node's path is not indexed. 
Both nodes have the same path, and a search by path retrieves the first node only. 

The node mapping included the following annotations:

@Node(jcrMixinTypes="mix:referenceable,mix:lockable,mix:versionable") 
public class Article { 

        @Field(uuid=true) 
        private String id = null; 
        
        @Field(path=true) 
        private String path = null; 

        ....
}
