MergePolicy.OneMerge.segments should be List<SegmentInfo> not SegmentInfos, Remove Vector<SI> subclassing from SegmentInfos & more refactoring



Description:
SegmentInfos carries a bunch of fields beyond the list of SI, but for merging purposes these fields are unused.

We should cutover to List<SI> instead.

Also SegmentInfos subclasses Vector<SI>, this should be removed and the collections be hidden inside the class. We can add unmodifiable views on it (asList(), asSet()).
