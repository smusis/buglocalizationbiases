Choose a specific Directory implementation running the CheckIndex main



Description:
It should be possible to choose a specific Directory implementation to use during the CheckIndex process when we run it from its main.
What about an additional main parameter?
In fact, I'm experiencing some problems with MMapDirectory working with a big segment, and after some failed attempts playing with maxChunkSize, I decided to switch to another FSDirectory implementation but I needed to do that on my own main.
Should we also consider to use a FileSwitchDirectory?
I'm willing to contribute, could you please let me know your thoughts about it?
