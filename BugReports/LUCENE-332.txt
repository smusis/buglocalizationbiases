nightly build/javadocs for sandbox



Description:
This isn't something i think is crucial, but since i've been on the lucene-users
mailing list (less then 2 months) I've seen several people post questions asking
where they can find documentation on some module available in the sandbox.

the answer of course is usually that they should download the source and build
the javadocs themselves, but since it keeps coming up, I figured i'd suggest
setting up a nightly "build" of the whole sandbox, including the javadocs.

if nothing else, it will cut down on the number of questions -- but i think it
may also have an added benefit to the size of the user base.  In my experience,
people tend to be more willing to download/install something and try it out
after they've read the docs online.
