Cached Item could be lost in cache



Description:
since items and itemstate are cache in week/soft reference maps, they can disappear from the caches after a GC cycle, and code like this:

if (isCached(id)) {
  return retrieveItem(id);
}

has potential to fail. log entries like:

failed to build path of c2eeecbe-6126-45a2-a38a-002361095107: 3334d748-2790-4004-8bfa-09463624c7c4 has no child entry for 4897c961-f36f-4d46-87bd-f24f152138a4

are the result.
