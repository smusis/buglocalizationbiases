Extend FieldCache architecture to multiple Values



Description:
I would consider this a bug. It appears lots of people are working around this limitation, 
why don't we just change the underlying data structures to natively support multiValued fields in the FieldCache architecture?

Then functions() will work properly, and we can do things like easily geodist() on a multiValued field.

Thoughts?
