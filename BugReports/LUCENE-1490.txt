CJKTokenizer convert   HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS wrong



Description:
CJKTokenizer have these lines..
                if (ub == Character.UnicodeBlock.HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS) {
                    /** convert  HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS to BASIC_LATIN */
                    int i = (int) c;
                    i = i - 65248;
                    c = (char) i;
                }

This is wrong. Some character in the block (e.g. U+ff68) have no BASIC_LATIN counterparts.
Only 65281-65374 can be converted this way.

The fix is

             if (ub == Character.UnicodeBlock.HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS && i <= 65474 && i> 65281) {
                    /** convert  HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS to BASIC_LATIN */
                    int i = (int) c;
                    i = i - 65248;
                    c = (char) i;
                }
