Add subset method to BitVector



Description:
Recently I needed the ability to efficiently compute subsets of a BitVector. The method is:
  public BitVector subset(int start, int end)
where "start" is the starting index, inclusive and "end" is the ending index, exclusive.

Attached is a patch including the subset method as well as relevant unit tests.
