Further improvements to contrib/benchmark for testing NRT



Description:
Some small changes:

  * Allow specifying a priority for BG threads, after the "&"
    character; priority increment is + or - int that's added to main
    thread's priority to set child thread's.  For my NRT tests I make
    the reopen thread +2, the indexing threads +1, and leave searching
    threads at their default.

  * Added test case

  * NearRealTimeReopenTask now reports @ the end the full array of
    msec of each reopen latency

  * Added optional breakout of counts by time steps.  If you set
    log.time.step.msec to eg 1000 then reported counts for serial task
    sequence is broken out by 1 second windows.  EG you can use this
    to measure slowdown over time.
