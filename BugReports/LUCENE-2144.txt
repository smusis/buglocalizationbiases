InstantiatedIndexReader does not handle #termDocs(null) correct (AllTermDocs)



Description:
This patch contains core changes so someone else needs to commit it.

Due to the incompatible #termDocs(null) behaviour at least MatchAllDocsQuery, FieldCacheRangeFilter and ValueSourceQuery fails using II since 2.9.

AllTermDocs now has a superclass, AbstractAllTermDocs that also InstantiatedAllTermDocs extend.

Also:

 * II-tests made less plausable to pass on future incompatible changes to TermDocs and TermEnum
 * IITermDocs#skipTo and #next mimics the behaviour of document posisioning from SegmentTermDocs#dito when returning false
 * II now uses BitVector rather than sets for deleted documents
