Extend the consistency check in BundleDbPersistenceManager's to fix child-parent relations



Description:
It could happen that a child node is not in the ChildNodeEntries of its parent node.
You will get something like (javax.jcr.ItemNotFoundException: failed to build path of node1: parentNode has no child entry for node1) if you try to retrieve the path from node1.
We should handle such cases and fix it on consistency check
