Oracle JNDI DataSource support



Description:
When org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle.util.ConnectionFactory tries to get a connection from a JNDI Datasource without login and pasword, if no user/password are specified, they re retrieved as empty strings, not null, so it tries to do a ds.getConnection(user, password), which fails. Please complete the test line 66 as :
if ((user == null || user.length() > 0) && (password == null || password.length() > 0)) {

Sincerely,
