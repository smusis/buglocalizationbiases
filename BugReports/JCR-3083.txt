Degrade gracefully when reading invalid date values



Description:
As noted in JCR-1996, it is possible for an old version of Jackrabbit to store date invalid date values in the repository. Currently such values cause exceptions when the repository attempts to read them. A better approach would be to automatically detect such dates and map them instead to string values to avoid losing any information. A client could then access the information as a string through the normal JCR API, and would only get a ValueFormatException when trying to read the value as a date, i.e. using the getDate() method.
