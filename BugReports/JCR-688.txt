Description:
As discussed in JCR-685, the current CachingNamespaceResolver class contains excessive synchronization causing monitor contention that reduces performance.

In JCR-685 there's a proposed patch that replaces synchronization with a read-write lock that would allow concurrent read access to the name cache.
