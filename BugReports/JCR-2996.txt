QOM to SQL2 doesn't cast numeric literals



Description:
SQL2 statements generated by the QueryObjectModel.getStatement() don't contain CAST(... AS ...) for numeric literals of types DECIMAL, DOUBLE, and LONG. The type information is lost, which can result in incorrect query results (depending on the query engine) if the generated SQL2 statement is executed.
