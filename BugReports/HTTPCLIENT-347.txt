MultiThreadedConnectionManager Accounting Problems



Description:
getConnectionsInPool() is certainly a more intutive name. 
At the same, as you already mentioned, certainly there need to be a connection killer method: 
MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.destroyIdleConnections(long idleTime) 

Also, I would recommend one method which could spit out connection statistics at any time for the 
given Connection Manager. This will be great method for testing purpose as well. 
MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.displayCurrentStatistics(); 
----------------------------------
Curent Connection Statistics
----------------------------------
Total connectinos in Pool = 10
Open connectinos          = 3
Close connections         = 5
Stale connections         = 2 
And, if are even more adventurous we could extend our report to: 
Average wait time for connection = 1356 ms
Maximum wait time for connectino = 1892 ms
