nuke/clean up AtomicReader.hasNorms



Description:
implementations already have to return fieldInfos() [which can tell you this], and normValues() [which can also tell you this].

So if we want to keep it, I think it should just have a final implementation and not be required for FilterReaders, etc.

Or we can just nuke it... do we really need 3 ways to do the same thing?
