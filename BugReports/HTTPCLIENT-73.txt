No way to get the requestBody out of a PostMethod or use if extending class



Description:
Attempting to extend the PostMethod class I discovered that I had no access to 
the requestBody because the member is declared private and there is no get 
method.

I was trying to override the setRequestContentLength() when I discovered the 
problem.

So my enhancement request specifically is:
1. add a get method to be able to get the requestBody (probably a get method to 
the parameters as well)
2. (optionally) make the requestBody and parameters members protected instead 
of private so extending the class is easier.

In case you were wondering, the reason for extending the class was to add the 
ability to set a timeout value on the httpconnection and also the ability to 
set the character encoding of the request body.  I don't know if these are 
worthy of an enhancement request but I require them for what I'm doing.  Nice 
work by the way.

Thank you.
