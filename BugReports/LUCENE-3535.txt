move PerFieldCodecWrapper into codecs package



Description:
PerFieldCodecWrapper is a codec, but its 'hardwired' as lucene's only codec currently (except for PreFlex/3.x case)

it lets you choose a format for the postings lists per-field.

I think we should move this to the codecs package as a start... just a rote refactor.
