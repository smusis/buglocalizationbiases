Add support for large number of users in a group



Description:
In the current implementation there are several factors which limit the number of users in a group:

- group membership is recorded in a multi valued property which does not scale well
- members of groups are collected eagerly which does not scale well

I propose to add complementary support for recording group membership in a node structure to the current solution. That node structure would - similar to users and groups - add intermediate nodes when a group reaches a certain threshold on the number of its users.
