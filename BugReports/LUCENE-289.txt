[patch] better support gcj compilation



Description:
There are two methods in IndexReader.java called 'delete'. That is a reserved
keyword in C++ and these methods cause trouble for gcj which implements a clever
workaround in renaming them delete$ but the OS X dynamic linker doesn't pick-up
on it.
The attached patch renames delete(int) to deleteDocument(int) and delete(Term)
to deleteDocuments(Term) and deprecates the delete methods (as requested by Doug
Cutting).
