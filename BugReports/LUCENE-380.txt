A new Greek Analyzer for Lucene



Description:
I would like to contribute a greek analyzer for lucene. It is based on the
existing Russian analyzer and features:

- most common greek character sets, such as Unicode, ISO-8859-7 and Windows-1253
- a collection of common greek stop words
- conversion of characters with diacritics (accent, diaeresis) in the lower case
filter, as well as handling of special characters, such as small final sigma

For the character sets I used RFC 1947 (Greek Character Encoding for Electronic
Mail Messages) as a reference. I have incorporated this analyzer in Luke as well
as used it successfully in a recent project of my company (EBS Ltd.).

I hope you will find it a useful addition to the project.
