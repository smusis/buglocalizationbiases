Cloned SegmentReaders fail to share FieldCache entries



Description:
I just hit this on LUCENE-1516, which returns a cloned readOnly
readers from IndexWriter.

The problem is, when cloning, we create a new [thin] cloned
SegmentReader for each segment.  FieldCache keys directly off this
object, so if you clone the reader and do a search that requires the
FieldCache (eg, sorting) then that first search is always very slow
because every single segment is reloading the FieldCache.

This is of course a complete showstopper for LUCENE-1516.

With LUCENE-831 we'll switch to a new FieldCache API; we should ensure
this bug is not present there.  We should also fix the bug in the
current FieldCache API since for 2.9, users may hit this.
