IndexCommit.getFileNames() should not return dups



Description:
If the index was created with autoCommit false, and more than 1
segment was flushed during the IndexWriter session, then the shared
doc-store files are incorrectly duplicated in
IndexCommit.getFileNames().  This is because that method is walking
through each SegmentInfo, appending its files to a list.  Since
multiple SegmentInfo's may share the doc store files, this causes dups.

To fix this, I've added a SegmentInfos.files(...) method, and
refactored all places that were computing their files one SegmentInfo
at a time to use this new method instead.
