NamespaceRegistryTest.testRegisterNamespace test assumptions



Description:
NamespaceRegistryTest.testRegisterNamespace() makes the assumption that it is possible to create arbitrarily nodes inside the root folder.

This is not required to be the case.

Proposal: 

- get the name of the test node from the config, and

- use a property rather than a child node for the test (as far as I can tell, many repositories will not allow node names in namespaces other than the empty one).
