refactoring of docvalues params in Codec.java



Description:
While working on LUCENE-2621 I am trying to do some cleanup of the Codec APIs, currently Codec.java has a boolean for getDocValuesUseCFS()

I think this is an impl detail that should not be in Codec.java: e.g. i might make a SimpleText impl that uses only 1 file and then the param
is awkward.

So, instead I created Sep impls that dont use CFS (use separate files) and placed them under the sep package, if you don't want to use
CFS you can just use these implementations in your codec.
