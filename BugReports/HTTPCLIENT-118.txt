Build with JDK 1.4, get many javadoc warnings



Description:
Building httpclient "dist" ant target, I get lots of "warning - The first
sentence is interpreted to be:".

As the summary says, I get these warnings when I build using JDK 1.4.  Using JDK
1.3.1 yields far fewer problems.  I see this with the latest sources as of this
posting.
