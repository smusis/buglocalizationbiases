Can't use proxy server with https



Description:
There doesn't seem to be a way to configure HttpClient to use both HTTPS and a
proxy server at the same time.  It's not clear if this was just an oversight or
if there was a deliberate decision to not support this combination for some reason.

Assuming that it was an oversight, the fix seems to just require one more
variation of startSession() in HttpClient.java which would be the following:

   public void startSession(String host, int port,
                            String proxyhost, int proxyport, boolean https) {
       connection = new HttpConnection(proxyhost,proxyport,host,port,https);
   }
