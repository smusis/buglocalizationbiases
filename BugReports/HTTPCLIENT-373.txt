Allow configuration of SO_LINGER



Description:
There is currently no way to configure the SO_LINGER option on a socket.

Please change the HttpClient class to allow the configuration of the SO_LINGER
option on a socket, similar to the way the SO_TIMEOUT can be configured.

Suggested extension to the interface of the HttpClient class:
- Add method setSoLinger() to set the current setting for SO_LINGER. The method
could accept one argument. A negative value could indicate that the SO_LINGER
should be disabled.
- Add method getSoLinger() that returns the current setting for SO_LINGER. A
negative value would indicate that the SO_LINGER option is disabled.
