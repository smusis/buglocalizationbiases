Unable to login with two different Credentials to same workspace in one Transaction



Description:
I'm using the Jackrabbit 1.2.1 JCA adapter and trying to access in a SessionBean-Method with Container Transaction a Workspace with 2 different Credentials. 
The Method takes about 400ms to finish but no commit on TransactionContextr occurs (Debugging ..) only the prepare was called 2 times .
The Container hangs on the PostInvoke Method about 5 seconds and then i get a "javax.transaction.xa.XAException" 
with the Warn Message: Transaction rolled back because timeout expired

The code ..
Context ctx = new InitialContext(); 
Repository repository = (Repository) ctx.lookup("java:comp/env/jackrabbit"); 
Credentials credentials = new SimpleCredentials("user1", "password1".toCharArray()); 
Credentials credentials2 = new SimpleCredentials("user2", "password2".toCharArray()); 
Session session1 = repository.login(credentials, "default"); 
Session session2 = repository.login(credentials2, "default"); 

Session1 adds a node to the workspace .. and with the session2 i do nothing except the login !
If i make no second login the Method works fine.
