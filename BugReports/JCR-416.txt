Proposed solution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The situation described before leads me to the following conclusion:

- IOHandler should not only read/write resource data and properties during GET, PUT, PROPFIND but should
   also take care of setting/removing properties upon PROPPATCH.

- Since the previous suggestion would still limit the properties to (jcr:encoding, jcr:mimeType and
   jcr:lastModified), we may think about changing the default nodetype for the jcr:content node to
   nt:unstructured.

I guess this would meet the requirements for those expecting a webDAV server that is (as a first step)
not limited regarding PROPPATCH. Second it would allow to have a handling of property modifications
which is specific for individual resource types instead of trying to set all properties to the uppermost node.
