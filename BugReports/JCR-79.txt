EventFilter misses Events for same Nodetype



Description:
If an ObservationListener registers with a NodeType-filter, 
it only gets informed about events on Sub-NodeTypes of the ones specified in the filter but not on the NodeType itself.

Example:
========
ObservationManager om = wsp.getObservationManager();
om.addEventListener(listener, Event.PROPERTY_ADDED, "/", true, null, new String[]{"nt:unstructured"}, true);

would receive notifications on nodes of type "rep:root", which is based on "nt:unstructured" but not of "nt:unstructured"
