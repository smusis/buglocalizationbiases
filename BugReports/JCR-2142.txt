InternalValue should implement QValue.discard() for BINARY types



Description:
currently jackrabbit-core always extracts the BLOBFileValue in order to free resources. Since InternalValue now implements QValue this could be achieved on the InternalValue directly.
However, currently the base implementation is inherited instead of dealing with the BLOBFileValues.
