[PATCH] remove unused variables



Description:
Seems I'm the only person who has the "unused variable" warning turned on in 
Eclipse :-) This patch removes those unused variables and imports (for now 
only in the "search" package). This doesn't introduce changes in 
functionality, but it should be reviewed anyway: there might be cases where 
the variables *should* be used, but they are not because of a bug.
