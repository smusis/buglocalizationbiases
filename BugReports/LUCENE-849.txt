contrib/benchmark:  configurable HTML Parser, external classes to path, exhaustive doc maker



Description:
"doc making" enhancements:

1. Allow configurable html parser, with a new html.parser property.
Currently TrecDocMaker is using the Demo html parser. With this new property this can be overridden.

2. allow to add external class path, so the benchmark can be used with modified makers/parsers without having to add code to Lucene.
Run benchmark with e.g. "ant run-task -Dbenchmark.ext.classpath=/myproj/myclasses"

3. allow to crawl a doc maker until exhausting all its files/docs once, without having to know in advance how many docs it can make. 
This can be useful for instance if the input data is in zip files.
