Content-Length & Transfer-Encoding request headers should be handled by entity enclosing methods



Description:
Currently 'Content-Length' & 'Transfer-Encoding' request headers are handled by 
the HttpMethodBase class. This is conceptually wrong and error-prone in my 
opinion. Entity enclosing methods should control 'Content-Length' & 'Transfer-
Encoding' request headers instead, as they provide request content and 
encapsulate the requisite content transfer logic.
