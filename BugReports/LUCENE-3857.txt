exceptions from other threads in beforeclass/etc do not fail the test



Description:
Lots of tests create indexes in beforeClass methods, but if an exception is thrown from another thread
it won't fail the test... e.g. this test passes:
{code}
public class TestExc extends LuceneTestCase {
  @BeforeClass
  public static void beforeClass() {
    new Thread() {
      public void run() {
        throw new RuntimeException("boo!");
      }  
    }.start();
  }
  
  public void test() { }
}
{code}

this is because the uncaught exception handler is in setup/teardown
