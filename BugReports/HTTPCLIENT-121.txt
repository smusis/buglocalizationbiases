Cookie.java blowing up on cookies from "country code" domains



Description:
The following exception is thrown from Cookie.java when receiving a cookie from
a "country code" domain such as amazon.ca.

     [java] INFO: Cookie.parse(): Rejecting set cookie header

domain attribute (".amazon.ca")
 for the given domain "www.amazon.ca".  It violoates the Netscape cookie
specification for non-special TLDs.

I've seen this problem with other .ca domains so this isn't a problem unique to
amazon.ca.

My guess would be that the problem is on line 929 of Cookie.java:

int domainParts = new StringTokenizer(cookie.getDomain(), ".").countTokens();

Where domainParts would be 2 for a domain like ".amazon.ca" instead of the 3
that the code is expecting.  I'm not that familiar with the cookie spec so I
could be completely wrong ;-)

The results above were done with the Oct 20/2002 gump build.
