Fuzzy query scoring issues



Description:
Queries which automatically produce multiple terms (wildcard, range, prefix, 
fuzzy etc)currently suffer from two problems:

1) Scores for matching documents are significantly smaller than term queries 
because of the volume of terms introduced (A match on query Foo~ is 0.1 
whereas a match on query Foo is 1).
2) The rarer forms of expanded terms are favoured over those of more common 
forms because of the IDF. When using Fuzzy queries for example, rare mis-
spellings typically appear in results before the more common correct spellings.


I will attach a patch that corrects the issues identified above by 
1) Overriding Similarity.coord to counteract the downplaying of scores 
introduced by expanding terms.
2) Taking the IDF factor of the most common form of expanded terms as the 
basis of scoring all other expanded terms.
