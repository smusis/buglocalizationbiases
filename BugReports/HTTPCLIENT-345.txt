[CONTRIB] SSL authenticating protocol socket factory



Description:
Here's the long promised SSL client/server authenticating socket factory. This
socket factory can be used to enforce client/server authentication during the
SSL context negotiation. Let me know what you think. Please, please someone
proof-read the accompanying javadocs and let me know if the text is comprehensible 

I have also tweaked EasySSLProtocolSocketFactory a little

The patch is against HTTPCLIENT_2_0_BRANCH
