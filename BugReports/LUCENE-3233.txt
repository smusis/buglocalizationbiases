HuperDuperSynonymsFilterâ„¢



Description:
The current synonymsfilter uses a lot of ram and cpu, especially at build time.

I think yesterday I heard about "huge synonyms files" three times.

So, I think we should use an FST-based structure, sharing the inputs and outputs.
And we should be more efficient with the tokenStream api, e.g. using save/restoreState instead of cloneAttributes()
