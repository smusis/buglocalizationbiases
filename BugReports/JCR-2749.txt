Closing a session twice shouldn't write a warning in the log



Description:
When closing a session twice the following warning is written to the log file as of JCR-2741:

"This session has already been closed. See the chained exception for a trace of where the session was closed."

I think the second "close()" should simply be ignored, without warning.
