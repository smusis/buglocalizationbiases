need members of MultipartRequestEntity to be "protected" instead of "private" to make it extendable for multipart/related



Description:
As explained in the mailing-list[1], I'd like to have some of 
MultipartRequestEntity move from "private" visibility to "protected" visibility,
to be able to extend as MultipartRelatedRequestEntity. Namely, the attribute
"parts" and the method "getMultipartBoundary" would be needed.

Thank you.
