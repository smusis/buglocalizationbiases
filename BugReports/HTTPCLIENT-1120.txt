DefaultHttpRequestRetryHandler#retryRequest should not retry aborted requests



Description:
DefaultHttpRequestRetryHandler#retryRequest incorrectly retries aborted requests; I have seen the following log messages in JMeter:

org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient: I/O exception (java.net.SocketException) caught when processing request: socket closed
org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient: Retrying request

and

org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient: I/O exception (java.net.BindException) caught when connecting to the target host: Address already in use: connect
org.apache.http.impl.client.DefaultHttpClient: Retrying connect

The abort() method sets the isAborted() flag, but the retry handler does not check it.
