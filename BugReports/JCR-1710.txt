Promote ChildNodeEntry and ChildNodeEntries to top level classes.



Description:
The current NodeState class is quite heavy weight (source code wise) and the inner class ChildNodeEntry is used in a lot of places outside of NodeState. I think it is useful to have them promoted to top level classes.
