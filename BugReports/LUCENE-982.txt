Create new method optimize(int maxNumSegments) in IndexWriter



Description:
Spinning this out from the discussion in LUCENE-847.

I think having a way to "slightly optimize" your index would be useful
for many applications.

The current optimize() call is very expensive for large indices
because it always optimizes fully down to 1 segment.  If we add a new
method which instead is allowed to stop optimizing once it has <=
maxNumSegments segments in the index, this would allow applications to
eg optimize down to say <= 10 segments after doing a bunch of updates.
This should be a nice compromise of gaining good speedups of searching
while not spending the full (and typically very high) cost of
optimizing down to a single segment.

Since LUCENE-847 is now formalizing an API for decoupling merge policy
from IndexWriter, if we want to add this new optimize method we need
to take it into account in LUCENE-847.
