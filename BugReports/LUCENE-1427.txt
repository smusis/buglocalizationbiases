QueryWrapperFilter should not do scoring



Description:
The purpose of QueryWrapperFilter is to simply filter to include the docIDs that match the query.

Its implementation is wasteful now because it computes scores for those matching docs even though the score is unused.  We could fix this by getting a Scorer and iterating through the docs without asking for the score:

Maybe I'm missing something, but this seams like a simple win?
