Surround query language



Description:
This is a copy of what I posted about a year ago. 
 
The whole thing is hereby licenced under the Apache Licence 2.0, 
copyright 2005 Apache Software Foundation. 
 
For inclusion in Lucene (sandbox perhaps?) it will need 
at least the following adaptations: 
- renaming of package names 
  (org.surround to somewhere org.apache.lucene ) 
- moves of the source files to corresponding directories 
 
Although it uses the identifier sncf in some places 
I'm not associated with French railroads, but I like the TGV. 
 
Regards, 
Paul Elschot
