FileRequestEntity in SVN does not close input file



Description:
FileRequestEntity.java in SVN does not close input file - however the version on the web page:

http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/performance.html

has a finally clause that closes the file ;-) - perhaps the source code should too...!
