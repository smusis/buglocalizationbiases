Stats for the PersistenceManager



Description:
Statistics for the PersistenceManager impl that cover: 
 - bundle cache access count, 
 - bundle cache miss count, 
 - bundle cache miss avg duration (this avg includes the penalty of having to load from the underlying storage / can be interpreted as avg read latency as there is no cache involved) 
 - bundle writes per second

What it doesn't cover is :
 - number of bundles
 - size of workspace
as these are values that are expensive to compute on demand, and caching them would imply being able to store the values (which is not possible currently).
