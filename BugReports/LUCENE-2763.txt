Swap URL+Email recognizing StandardTokenizer and UAX29Tokenizer



Description:
Currently, in addition to implementing the UAX#29 word boundary rules, StandardTokenizer recognizes email adresses and URLs, but doesn't provide a way to turn this behavior off and/or provide overlapping tokens with the components (username from email address, hostname from URL, etc.).

UAX29Tokenizer should become StandardTokenizer, and current StandardTokenizer should be renamed to something like UAX29TokenizerPlusPlus (or something like that).
