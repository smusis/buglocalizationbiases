Avoid ${project.version} in dependencies



Description:
Another one for Jackrabbit 1.5, we should avoid using ${project.version} for our dependencies and override the versions of any transitive dependencies that use ${project.version} (notably the Jetty dependencies in jackrabbit-standalone) to avoid problems with Maven < 2.0.9 caused by MNG-2339 [1].
