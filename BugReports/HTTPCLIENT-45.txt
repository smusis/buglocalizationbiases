HTTP Version configuration and tracking



Description:
HTTP version tracking is currently oversimplified with a single http11 boolean. 
Extend this to handle any http version simply, and efficiently.

Possible suggestion:
> get rid of setHttp11() an isHttp11
> void setHttpVersion(String version)
> String getHttpVersion()
> boolean isHttpVersion(String version)
