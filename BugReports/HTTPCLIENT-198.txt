The PostMethod did not bring back response headers from proxy servers



Description:
Description:

When doing tunnelling through proxy servers, in case of 407 response, the 
wrapper class ConnectMethod failed to pass the response header back to the 
wrapped method (PostMethod in our case).  As result, the response headers are 
not passed back to the application.

Proposed Fix:
Change the ConnectMethod to use the wrapped method instance to get response 
headers.  It will be reinitialized again if "CONNECT" is successful.

Also have to modify the addProxyAuthorizationRequestHeader code to use the 
wrapped method for the authenticator to work.
