Support lower and upper case functions in "order by" clause



Description:
The query languages should support lower- and upper-case functions within the "order by" clause.  This would provide case-insensitive ordering of query results.

Example:  Find all "nt:base" nodes ordered by the "foo" property, but ignoring case

In XPath:

//element(*,nt:base) order by fn:lower-case(@foo)

In SQL:

SELECT * FROM nt:base ORDER BY lower(foo)
