sysview export/import of multivalue properties seems not to work



Description:
the sysview export of multivalue properties does not differ from the export of singlevalue properties.

if a mv-property contains only 1 value, how can the import find the correct property-def?

currently, it throws: 
  javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: no matching property definition found for <propertyname>
