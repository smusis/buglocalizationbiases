FilterIndexReader in trunk does not implement getSequentialSubReaders() correctly



Description:
Since LUCENE-2459, getSequentialSubReaders() in FilterIndexReader returns null, so it returns an atomic reader. But If you call then any of the enum methods, it throws Exception because the underlying reader is not atomic.

We should move the null-returning method to SlowMultiReaderWrapper and fix FilterIndexReader's default to return in.getSequentialSubReaders(). Ideally an implementation must of course also wrap the sub-readers.

If we change this we have to look into other Impls like the MultiPassIndexSplitter if we need to add atomicity.
