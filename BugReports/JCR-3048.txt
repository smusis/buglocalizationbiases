Upgrade to latest Apache parent POM



Description:
We're quite a bit behind the latest and greatest of the Apache parent POMs (org.apache:apache), mostly since we're inheriting it through the now mostly unused org.apache.jackrabbit:parent POM.

I'd like to move things back from the o.a.j:parent POM to the jackrabbit-parent POM that's located inside trunk. This will allow us to upgrade to the latest Apache parent POM without the trouble of an extra release of the o.a.j:parent POM.
