tweak AppendingCodec to write segments_N compatible with 'normal' Lucene



Description:
Just an easy improvement from LUCENE-3490:

Currently AppendingCodec writes a different segments_N format (it writes no checksum at all in commit())
If you don't configure your codecprovider correctly in IndexReader, you will get read past EOF.
(we have some proposed fixes for this stuff in LUCENE-3490 branch)

But besides this, all it really needs to do is no-op prepareCommit(), it can still write the 'final' checksum
which is a good thing.
