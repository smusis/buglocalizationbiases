spi2dav : EventJournal not  implemented



Description:
i didn't look at the details just realized that all EventJournalTest of the TCK fail in the setup
jcr2spi - spi2dav(ex) - jcr-server.
i assume that this is due to missing implementation (the corresponding SPI method throws UnsupportedRepositoryOperationException).
