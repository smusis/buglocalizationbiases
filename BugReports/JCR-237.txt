Item.isNew() does not work correctly within a transaction



Description:
javadoc on Item.isNew() states:

     * Returns <code>true</code> if this is a new item, meaning that it exists only in transient
     * storage on the <code>Session</code> and has not yet been saved. Within a transaction,
     * <code>isNew</code> on an <code>Item</code> may return <code>false</code> (because the item
     * has been saved) even if that <code>Item</code> is not in persistent storage (because the
     * transaction has not yet been committed).

but currently, Item.isNew() returns "true" after beeing saved in a transaction.
