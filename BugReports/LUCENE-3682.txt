Add deprecated 'transition' api for Document/Field



Description:
I think for 4.0 we should have a deprecated transition api for Field so you can do new Field(..., Field.Store.xxx, Field.Index.yyy) like before.

These combinations would just be some predefined fieldtypes that are used behind the scenes if you use these deprecated ctors

Sure it wouldn't be 'totally' backwards binary compat for Field.java, but why must it be all or nothing? I think this would eliminate a big
hurdle for people that want to check out 4.x
