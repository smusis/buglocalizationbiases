NTLM class registers Sun JCE implementation by default



Description:
Currently the NTLM class attempts to load and register the Sun JCE implementation unless a 
System property is set to indicate a different JCE to use.  We should remove this entirely and leave 
the installation and configuration of the JCE to the application rather than trying to do it ourselves 
as this could cause problems with other implementations of JCE.  I'll attach an initial patch for this 
in a moment, with a patch for the documentation in the morning.  (Writing docs at 1am is never a 
good idea.)
