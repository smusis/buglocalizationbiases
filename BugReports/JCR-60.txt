primaryItemName is not inherited



Description:
if no primaryItemName is defined for a nodetype definition, it should be inherited from one of the supertypes. the spec is unclear about this, though it seems to be the natural behaviour.

for example when extending nt:resource, the subtype should not be force to redefine the jcr:data as primaryItemName.
