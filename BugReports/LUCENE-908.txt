MANIFEST.MF cleanup (main jar and luci customizations)



Description:
there are several problems with the MANIFEST.MF file used in the core jar, and some inconsistencies in th luci jar:

Lucli's build.xml has an own "jar" target and does not use the jar target from common-build.xml. The result
is that the MANIFEST.MF file is not consistent and the META-INF dir does not contain LICENSE.TXT and NOTICE.TXT.

Is there a reason why lucli behaves different in this regard? If not I think we should fix this.
