304 response status handling



Description:
I have an IBM WebSphere server that returns 304 responses with a Content-
Length header set to something other than 0 and the server is not closing the 
connection.  According to the HTTP RFC 
(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.5):

"The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always 
terminated by the first empty line after the header fields."

Obviously, the web server is returning a bad response but the HTTPClient 
blocks waiting on data in the response even though there shouldn't be any.  
Other HTTP clients (browsers) do not have this issue and seem to ignore the 
fact that the server set an invalid Content-Length in the response.
