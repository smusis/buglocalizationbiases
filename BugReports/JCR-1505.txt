Improve handling of inherited mixins



Description:
If an abstract class is annotated with a mixin type, the annotation must be repeated in concrete classes.

E.g.
@Node(jcrMixinTypes="mix:referenceable", isAbstract=true)
public abstract class Content {
...
...}

/**
* This class will not be referenceable
**/
@Node(extend=Content.class)
public class Page extends Content {
...
...
}

/**
* But this one will
**/
@Node(extend=Content.class, jcrMixinTypes="mix:referenceable")
public class Folder extends Content {
...
...
}

It would be nice if the annotation was inherited by default.
