Automatic staging of the non-Maven release artefacts



Description:
Currently the Jackrabbit release process includes the following manual steps in addition to the standard Maven release plugin invocations:

<script>
VERSION=x.y.z  # Release version number

# Prepare the release directory
mkdir target/$VERSION

# Copy the main release artifacts created in the release:perform stage
cp target/checkout/RELEASE-NOTES.txt target/$VERSION
cp target/checkout/target/jackrabbit-$VERSION-src.zip* target/$VERSION
cp target/checkout/jackrabbit-webapp/target/jackrabbit-webapp-$VERSION.war* target/$VERSION
cp target/checkout/jackrabbit-jca/target/jackrabbit-jca-$VERSION.rar* target/$VERSION
cp target/checkout/jackrabbit-standalone/target/jackrabbit-standalone-$VERSION.jar* target/$VERSION

# Add MD5 and SHA1 checksums
for BINARY in target/$VERSION/*.zip target/$VERSION/*ar; do
  openssl md5 < $BINARY > $BINARY.md5
  openssl sha1 < $BINARY > $BINARY.sha
done

# Upload the release directory to people.apache.org
scp -r target/$VERSION people.apache.org:public_html/jackrabbit/$VERSION
</script>

I'd like to automate these steps.
