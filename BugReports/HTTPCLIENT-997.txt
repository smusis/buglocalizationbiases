cache module should handle out-of-order validations properly and unconditionally refresh



Description:
There is a protocol recommendation that when we attempt to revalidate a cache entry, but we receive a response that has a Date header that's actually *older* than that of our current entry, we SHOULD revalidate again unconditionally with either max-age=0 or no-cache (since some upstream cache would appear to be out-of-date).
