optimization in sending request



Description:
By doing network sniffering, I noticed that httpclient send the request line 
and headers as separate packages. All other httpclient, including IE, Netscape, 
Java's URLConnection all send it as one package. This can be easily fixed using 
some buffering in HttpMethodBase.
