ProtocolException thrown on slightly broken headers



Description:
HTTPClient throws an exception when parsing headers returned by GET from the
following URL:

 http://butler.cit.nih.gov/hembase/hembase.taf

The headers returned are as follows:

HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nServer: WebSTAR/1.0 ID/ACGI\r\nMIME-Version:
1.0\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nSet-Cookie:
Tango_UserReference=ADC5871C57FABEDEC63DD47B; path=/\n\r\r\n\r\n<!DOCTYPE HTML
PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">...

Please note the superfluous \r in the line separating headers from the body.
IMHO this type of error should generate a warning, but then it should cause a
graceful recovery. Currently a ProtocolException is thrown.

Standard java.net.HttpURLConnection handles this just fine, without giving any
warning.
