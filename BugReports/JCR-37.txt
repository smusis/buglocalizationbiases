select query fails on 'like xxx322' statement



Description:
In class org.apache.jackrabbit.core.search.lucene.WildcardTermEnum, there's a condition around line 77 like

...
if (Character.isLetter(likePattern.charAt(i))) {
...

which fails on query like
SELECT * FROM my:type LOCATION /news// WHERE my:text LIKE "asd2"

it should be changed to 

if (Character.isLetter(likePattern.charAt(i)) || Character.isDigit(likePattern.charAt(i))) {
