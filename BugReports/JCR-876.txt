ManageableCollectionUtil should not throw "unsupported" JcrMapping exception



Description:
Many times, the object model'd code cannot be altered for ocm.

To avoid the "unsupported" exception in almost all such cases, use a delegating wrapper class to encapsulate a Collection.    The wrapper class implements MaangeableCollection.

Since delegation is a performance hit, make the test below the last resort for *object*  conversion in the method:
public static ManageableCollection getManageableCollection(Object object) 

Proposed "catchall" test and program action:

            if (object instanceof Collection) {
                return new ManageableCollectionImpl((Collection)object);
            }
