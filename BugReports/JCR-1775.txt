Transaction-safe versioning



Description:
I've been working on a partial fix to JCR-630. Instead of implementing fully transactional versioning (i.e. a checkin will disappear when a transactin is rolled back), I'm ensuring that all versioning operations within a transaction will leave the version store in a consistent state even if the transaction otherwise fails at any point.
