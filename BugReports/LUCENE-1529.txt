back-compat tests ("ant test-tag") should test JAR drop-in-ability



Description:

We now test back-compat with "ant test-tag", which is very useful for
catching breaks in back compat before committing.

However, that currently checks out "src/test" sources and then
compiles them against the trunk JAR, and runs the tests.  Whereas our
back compat policy:

  http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BackwardsCompatibility

states that no recompilation is required on upgrading to a new JAR.
Ie you should be able to drop in the new JAR in place of your old one
and things should work fine.

So... we should fix "ant test-tag" to:

  * Do full checkout of core sources & tests from the back-compat-tag

  * Compile the JAR from the back-compat sources

  * Compile the tests against that back-compat JAR

  * Swap in the trunk JAR

  * Run the tests
