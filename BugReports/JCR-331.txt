RepositoryConfig instance can not be reused once it has been passed to RepositoryImpl constructor



Description:
RepositoryConfig and other *Config classes maintain state apart from parsed configuration information;
specifically they instantiate FileSystem implementations based on their configurations. this makes it
for the config consumers very hard to control the lifecycle of such FileSystem instances as they need
to close the file systems on repository shutdown.

the following code illustrates the issue:

RepositoryConfig repConf = RepositoryConfig.create(configFile, repHomeDir);
RepositoryImpl rep = RepositoryImpl.create(repConf);
// ...
rep.shutdown();

rep = RepositoryImpl.create(repConf);   
// ==> repConfig (et al) contains references to FileSystem objects 
// that have been closed by previous rep.shutdown() call
