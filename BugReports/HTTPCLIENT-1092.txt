ClientPNames.VIRTUAL_HOST is used as is; if not provided, the port should be derived from the target URL



Description:
The parameter ClientPNames.VIRTUAL_HOST allows the default Host header to be overridden.

Currently the code uses the HttpHost entry as provided, and does not automatically add the port suffix.
This means that user code has to provide the port - but only if it's not the default for the protocol.

It would be simpler for the user if the port were automatically added.

If the user does not provide the port, the code should derive it from the target URL.

If the user does provide a port number, then that should be used (as is done currently). 
This allows the user to override the port (if that should ever prove necessary).
