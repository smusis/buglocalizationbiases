Use separate index for jcr:system tree



Description:
Currently each workspace index also includes index data of repository wide data (e.g. version nodes under jcr:system). There are several drawbacks with this approach:

- indexing is duplicated and does not scale when using a lot of workspaces
- workspaces cannot be 'put to sleep' when they are not actively used.

The repository should have an additional index for system data, which includes: versioning and nodetype representation in content. Basically data under /jcr:system.

Queries issued on a workspace will then use two index to execute the query: the workspace index and the system index.
