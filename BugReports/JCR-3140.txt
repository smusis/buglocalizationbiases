Add configurable hook for password validation



Description:
it's a common use case that applications would like to enforce additional logic associated with 
changing a user password. currently this can only be achieved by using a derived user implementation.
by extending the functionality added with JCR-3118 it was fairly trivial to provide a hook for those
custom password validation checks, writing password expiration date etc.etc.
