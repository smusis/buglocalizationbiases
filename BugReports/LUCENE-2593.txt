disk full can cause index corruption in certain cases



Description:
Robert uncovered this nasty bug, in adding more randomness to
oal.index tests...

I got a standalone test to show the issue; the corruption path is
as follows:

  * The merge hits an initial exception (eg disk full when merging the
    postings).

  * In handling this exception, IW closes all the sub-readers,
    suppressing any further exceptions.

  * If one of these sub-readers has pending deletions, which happens
    if readers are pooled in IW, it will flush them.  If that flush
    hits a 2nd exception (eg disk full), then SegmentReader
    [incorrectly] leaves the SegmentInfo's delGen advanced by 1,
    referencing a corrupt file, yet the SegmentReader is still
    forcefully closed.

  * If enough disk frees up such that a later IW.commit/close
    succeeds, the resulting segments file will reference an invalid
    deletions file.
