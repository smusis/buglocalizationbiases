Missing equals and hashcode preventing the re-use of SharedFieldSortComparator



Description:
As briefly mentioned in the dev email list, improperly implemented (i.e., missing - using the default Object implementation) equals and hashcode in SearchIndex.java prevents the reuse of a SharedFieldSortComparator between different queries when nothing has changed in the repository.  In tests, this appears to have a fairly significant negative performance impact.

Please see the following for the correct code:
