Add user manager performance tests 



Description:
We should add some performance tests for validating JCR-2710 and related. That is we should measure performance for creating users and groups and adding/removing users to/from groups. This should be done for both repository configurations: one with the old content model (group membership in property) and one with the new content model introduced with JCR-2710 (group membership in b-tree like node structure).
