add icu-based tokenizer for unicode text segmentation



Description:
I pulled out the last part of LUCENE-1488, the tokenizer itself and cleaned it up some.

The idea is simple:
* First step is to divide text into writing system boundaries (scripts)
* You supply an ICUTokenizerConfig (or just use the default) which lets you tailor segmentation on a per-writing system basis.
* This tailoring can be any BreakIterator, so rule-based or dictionary-based or your own.

The default implementation (if you do not customize) is just to do UAX#29, but with tailorings for stuff with no clear word division:
* Thai (uses dictionary-based word breaking)
* Khmer, Myanmar, Lao (uses custom rules for syllabification)

Additionally as more of an example i have a tailoring for hebrew that treats the punctuation special. (People have asked before
for ways to make standardanalyzer treat dashes differently, etc)
