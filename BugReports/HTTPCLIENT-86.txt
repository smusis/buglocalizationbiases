need to add a default constructor for Cookie



Description:
The Cookie class doesn't have a default (no argument) constructor. This is 
causing problem for some framework which supports marshalling and unmarshalling 
of data types. e.g. a SOAP implementation may need to do this to transfer it 
between the SOAP server and SOAP client. It would be nice to add a default 
constructor, as it won't break anything, follows JavaBean convention, and 
potentially save user some trouble in the future.
