Cache also failed principal lookups



Description:
The principal cache in Jackrabbit normally does a good job in ensuring good performance in critical areas like ACL evaulation. However, the cache only includes successful principal lookups, so an ACE that references a missing (or mistyped) principal can cause notable performance issues as a new principal lookup is needed whenever the node covered by such an ACL is accessed.

To solve that problem I propose that we extend the principal cache to also cover negative principal lookups.
