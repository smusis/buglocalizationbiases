Subject: Error with multiple connections

Hello,

 

I am having some problems while trying multiple connections over a
HttpClient object with a MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager. I am
launching 10 threads and each thread executes some GetMethods using this
HttpClient object.

 

Some times I got an error like this:

 

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Buffer size <= 0

      at java.io.BufferedInputStream.<init>(Unknown Source)

      at
org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpClient.java:4
97)

      at Main$Hilo.run(Main.java:58)

 

Does anybody have any idea? 

 

Thanks in advance,

Jorge
