openReaderPassed not populated in CheckIndex.Status.SegmentInfoStatus



Description:
When using CheckIndex programatically, the openReaderPassed flag on the SegmentInfoStatus is never populated (so it always comes back false)

looking at the code, its clear that openReaderPassed is defined, but never used

furthermore, it appears that not all information that is propagated to the "InfoStream" is available via SegmentIinfoStatus

All of the following information should be able to be gather from public properties on the SegmentInfoStatus:
test: open reader.........OK
test: fields, norms.......OK [2 fields]
test: terms, freq, prox...OK [101 terms; 133 terms/docs pairs; 133 tokens]
test: stored fields.......OK [100 total field count; avg 1 fields per doc]
test: term vectors........OK [0 total vector count; avg 0 term/freq vector fields per doc]
