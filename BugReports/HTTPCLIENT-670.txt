add an interface for plugable dns clients



Description:
Currently Httpclient implicitly uses InetAddress.getByName() for DNS resolution.
This has some drawbacks. One is that the DNS cache of Java per default caches entries forever.

So I'd like to be able to replace InetAddress.getByName() with another DNS client implementation.
