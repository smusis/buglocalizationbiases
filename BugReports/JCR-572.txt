Referenced derby library behaves buggy on FreeBSD



Description:
The derby library referenced on dependencies page (http://jackrabbit.apache.org/dependencies.html) behaves buggy on FreeBSD. This is the same issue like the one with Magnolia CMS: http://jira.magnolia.info/browse/MAGNOLIA-818. Version derby-10.1.3.1 works fine.
