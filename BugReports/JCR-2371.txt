Core: WEAKREFERENCE properties object have type REFERENCE when being read from the persistent layer



Description:
it seems to me that WEAKREFERENCE properties are properly created and stored as such but are read as REFERENCE 
properties when built again from the persistent layer.

how to reproduce:

- create a new WEAKREFERENCE property and save the changes
- force reading from the persistent layer  (in my case I used Day's CRX and restartet the server)
- the former WEAKREFERENCE will now be displayed as REFERENCE.
