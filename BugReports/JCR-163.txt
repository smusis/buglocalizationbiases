Maven build failure in textfilter contrib project



Description:
I've tried to build the textfilters contrib but get the following error:

Attempting to download jackrabbit-0.16.4.1-dev.jar.
WARNING: Failed to download jackrabbit-0.16.4.1-dev.jar.
The build cannot continue because of the following unsatisfied dependency:
jackrabbit-0.16.4.1-dev.jar

I tried changing the project.xml to look for jackrabbit-1.0-dev.jar instead, but it didn't work, not sure what maven expects here, but should be an easy fix for somebody in the know.
