Infinite loop on NTLM authentication



Description:
I got an infinite loop on NTLM authentication if the authentication failed (bad credentials).

The state FAILED of the NTLM sheme is never catched in the method authenticate of the class HttpAuthenticator (line 123).
I fix temporatily this bug by adding a case for the protocol state HANDSHAKE.
