Mixins as supertypes do not appear to be queryable



Description:
When creating custom nodetypes that contain mixins as the supertype, nodes of the custom type do not appear to be queryable when using statements of the form: //element(*, mixin). Attached are a relatively simple JUnit test and compact type definition that seem to illustrate the problem.
