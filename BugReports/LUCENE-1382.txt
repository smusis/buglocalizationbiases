Allow storing user data when IndexWriter.commit() is called



Description:
Spinoff from here:

    http://www.mail-archive.com/java-user@lucene.apache.org/msg22303.html

The idea is to allow optionally passing an opaque String commitUserData to the IndexWriter.commit method.  This String would be stored in the segments_N file, and would be retrievable by an IndexReader.  Applications could then use this to assign meaning to each commit.

It would be nice to get this done for 2.4, but I don't think we should hold the release for it.
