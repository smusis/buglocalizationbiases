OutOfMemory problem: HandleMonitor does not release closed input streams



Description:
The class o.a.j.core.fs.local.HandleMonitor does not release closed MonitoredInputStream. There is a close method, but it is never called. The input streams are kept in a hash set / map of HandleMonitor. Eventually, this leads to an OutOfMemory exception after opening / closing many files.
