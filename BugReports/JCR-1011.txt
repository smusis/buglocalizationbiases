JCR2SPI: add configurable cache for Item instances (ItemManager)



Description:
Currently the ItemManager implementation uses a simple map with weak keys (ItemState) and weak values (Item) as cache.
Marcel recently suggested to replace this with a more sophisticated cache mechanism that can be configured.
