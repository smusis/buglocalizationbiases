repository.xml: throw an exception on error



Description:
Currently, unsupported parameters in repository.xml and workspace.xml are ignored.
To find problems earlier, such problems should result in an exception,
and starting such a repository should not be possible.
The same should happen for unsupported values.

For currently unavailable options
(such as text extraction filter classes if the class is not in the classpath),
at least a warning should be written to the error log, or an error should be thrown.
