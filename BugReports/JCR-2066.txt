NodeTypeRegistry could auto-subtype from nt:base



Description:
this is basically a copy of JCR-433, which was fixed but somehow sneaked in again:

when tying to register a (primary) nodetype that does not extend from nt:base the following error is
thrown:

"all primary node types except nt:base itself must be (directly or indirectly) derived from nt:base"

since the registry is able to detect this error, it would be easy to auto-subtype all nodetypes from nt:base. 
imo it's pointless to explicitly add the nt:base to every superclass set. as an analogy, you don't need to 
'extend from java.lang.Object' explicitly - the compiler does that automatically for your.
