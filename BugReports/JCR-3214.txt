[Lock] weird number for "infinite"



Description:
(this is a follow-up of JCR-3205)

i am surprised by the davex reply to a lock request with infinite timeout (before and after the fix from JCR-3205):


<D:timeout>Second-2147483</D:timeout>

this number is
2^21+50331

which seems pretty random to me. coincidally, this number is exactly 2^31 - 1 (2147483647) without the last 3 digits. can it be that there are some weird string operations happening on server side?
