The "jackrabbit-pool-" thread prevents the process from stopping



Description:
If the repository is not closed, and a session is still logged in, then the process doesn't terminate because of a non-daemon thread named "jackrabbit-pool-<n>". Test case:

public class TestThreadPreventsExit {
    public static void main(String... a) throws Exception {
        new TransientRepository().login(
                new SimpleCredentials("", new char[0]));
    }
}

This program doesn't stop.

The non-daemon thread was introduces as part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-2465

The fix is to use a daemon thread.
