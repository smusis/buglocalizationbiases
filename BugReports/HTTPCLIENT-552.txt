Add shutdown method to SimpleHttpConnectionManager



Description:
It would be useful to be able to close the connection in the
SimpleHttpConnectionManager. This could be achieved by adding a shutdown()
method as per the MultiThreadedConnectionManager.

Ideally this would be added to the HttpConnection interface, but this could
break existing implementations.

To avoid this, perhaps consider introducing a sub-interface with the method in it.

[Could also create an AbstractConnectionManager class - this would make it
easier to add more functions later]
