Unit and integration test cases for the new Similarities



Description:
Write test cases to test the new Similarities added in [LUCENE-3220|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3220]. Two types of test cases will be created:
 * unit tests, in which mock statistics are provided to the Similarities and the score is validated against hand calculations;
 * integration tests, in which a small collection is indexed and then searched using the Similarities.

Performance tests will be performed in a separate issue.
