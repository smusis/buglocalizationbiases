Redesign virtual host API



Description:
HttpClient is ignoring an explicity set host.  e.g. if you set the host like
client.getHostConfiguration().setHost("127.0.0.1") then execute a method looking
up say http://google.com then the program will connect to google.com rather than
the localhost.

The fix that works for me:

             hostconfig = new HostConfiguration(hostconfig);
-            if (uri.isAbsoluteURI()) {

                 hostconfig.setHost(uri);
             }

Note: Why do we care that the host is specified?  Why not just use the uri
authority?  In my case I have a virtual host running on several servers/IPs and
I need to make sure the request goes through to a specific IP and the response
that comes back is for the virtual host I am testing.
