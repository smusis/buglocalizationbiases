Invert IR.getDelDocs -> IR.getLiveDocs



Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-1536, where we need to fix the low level filtering
we do for deleted docs to "match" Filters (ie, a set bit means the doc
is accepted) so that filters can be pushed all the way down to the
enums when possible/appropriate.

This change also inverts the meaning first arg to
TermsEnum.docs/AndPositions (renames from skipDocs to liveDocs).
