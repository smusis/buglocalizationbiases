Simplify the usage of OCM annotations



Description:
If we are using more reflections during the OCM init phase (class descriptor loading), some OCM annotation settings are not necessary : 

@Node(isAbtract=true) : used to specify an abstract classes
@Node(extend=....) : used to specify the ancestor class
@Node(isInterface= ...) : used to specify the entity as an interface
@implement  : used to specify the associated interfaces

If this refactoring is done, we can set them as deprecated.

The performances will not suffer because this is done only once during the application startup (when the ObjectContentManager is initialized).
