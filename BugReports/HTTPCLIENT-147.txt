HttpClient enter 100% for endless time



Description:
I was working masively using HttpClient (I was testing it for usage within a 
server) and it got to 100% CPU for an endless time.

I was querying urls of the type 
http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/results.asp?WRD=<text>&sort=R&SAT=1

To reproduce it, run 100-200 urls with random words instead of <text> and 
you'll probably reproduce the problem.
