XMLReader logs fatal error to system out



Description:
Some test cases check if an appropriate exception is thrown when invalid XML is supplied, in that case the build in XMLReader in Java 1.5 logs a fatal error to system out.

This seems to be caused by a missing error handler on the XMLReader.
