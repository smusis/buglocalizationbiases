Spellchecker's dictionary iterator misbehaves



Description:
In LuceneDictionary, the LuceneIterator.hasNext() method has two issues that makes it misbehave:

1) If hasNext is called more than once, items are skipped
2) Much more seriously, when comparing fieldnames it is done with != rather than .equals() with the potential result that nothing is indexed
