Code cleanups for Java 1.5 and more.



Description:
I can't resist giving code a good cleansing when I start hacking.  Here's some simple things:
- Use character constants instead of string contstants
- Use java 1.5 style for loops
- Use StringBuilder where appropriate
- Fix javadocs
- switch somestring.equals("") to .length() == 0
-  simplify some boolean expressions
- eliminate redundant initializers
- fix some html nits
- remove final keyword from static methods
