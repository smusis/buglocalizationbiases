Web client/WebDAV fails to unescape workspace names



Description:
It seems that when you try to access to a workspace through the web client/webdav, and the workspace has special characteres like spaces on its name like ("my workspace"), then the web cliente/webdav is not able to load it.

Probablly the only thing to do is to unscape the workspace name.
