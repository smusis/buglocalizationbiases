Implement various ranking models as Similarities



Description:
With [LUCENE-3174|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-3174] done, we can finally work on implementing the standard ranking models. Currently DFR, BM25 and LM are on the menu.

Done:
 * {{EasyStats}}: contains all statistics that might be relevant for a ranking algorithm
 * {{EasySimilarity}}: the ancestor of all the other similarities. Hides the DocScorers and as much implementation detail as possible
 * _BM25_: the current "mock" implementation might be OK
 * _LM_
 * _DFR_
 * The so-called _Information-Based Models_
