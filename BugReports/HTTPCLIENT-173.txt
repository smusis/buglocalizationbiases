Multiple DIGEST authentication attempts with same credentials



Description:
HttpMethodBase's processAuthenticationResponse uses a set of realms to which
attempts to authenticate have already been made. The elements of the set are a
concatenation of the requested path and the value of the Authentication response
header.

For digest authentication this response header contains a nonce value, which is
uniquely generated by the server each time a 401 response is made. This makes it
impossible to recognize that authentication against this realm has been
attempted before and so all 100 attempts are made before returning. The nonce
should probably not be used in the realmsUsed element
