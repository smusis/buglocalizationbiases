Occasional "Host connection pool not found"



Description:
I'm using HttpClient with MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager in a crawler
application. The application issues requests to many hosts, in 10-20 parallel
request threads. Each thread creates a new GetMethod, but all threads use the
same instance of HttpClient, created once with a multi-threaded manager.

The code in each thread looks like this:

GetMethod get = new GetMethod(url);
try {
  int code = getSharedHttpClient().executeMethod(get);
  // ... read response, do stuff
} finally {
  get.releaseConnection();
}


From time to time I get an error like this:

Host connection pool not found, hostConfig=HostConfiguration[host=http://a.b.c]

where the url is a random url from my fetch list. I looked into the source code
of the nightly release (MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.java:979), but the
comment there is not enlightening... ;-) Any help or suggestions for further
debugging would be appreciated.
