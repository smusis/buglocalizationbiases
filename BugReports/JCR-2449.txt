Slow performance due to JCR-2138 (Prevent persistence of faulty back-references)



Description:
In revision 782898, the following code was introduced:

updateReferences() {
    for (Iterator i = local.addedStates(); i.hasNext();) {
        ...
        if (hasItemState(state.getId())) {
            ...
        }
    }
}

This will try to fetch inexistent nodes from the persistence manager.
Depending on the persistence manager implementation, this is very slow.
I hope there is a way to avoid this call, or if not, speed it up.
