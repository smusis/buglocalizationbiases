XPath query with child axis predicates



Description:
Executing a query using a long child path in a child axis predicate (like //*[a/b/c/d/e/@prop='something']) may return too many or not enough nodes.

I'll attach a zip file containing 2 tests cases showing this issue (I apologize but the test data are in French).
