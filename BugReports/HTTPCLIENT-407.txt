Errors in character entities in Javadoc for HttpVersion



Description:
There are some errors in the Javadoc for the HttpVersion class. This is the
class comment:

 *  <p>HTTP version, as specified in RFC 2616.</p>
 *  <p>
 *  HTTP uses a "&ltmajor&gt.&ltminor&gt" numbering scheme to indicate versions
 *  of the protocol. The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow
 *  the sender to indicate the format of a message and its capacity for
 *  understanding further HTTP communication, rather than the features
 *  obtained via that communication. No change is made to the version
 *  number for the addition of message components which do not affect
 *  communication behavior or which only add to extensible field values.
 *  The &ltminor&gt number is incremented when the changes made to the
 *  protocol add features which do not change the general message parsing
 *  algorithm, but which may add to the message semantics and imply
 *  additional capabilities of the sender. The &ltmajor&gt number is
 *  incremented when the format of a message within the protocol is
 *  changed. See RFC 2145 [36] for a fuller explanation.
 *  </p>
 *  <p>
 *  The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field
 *  in the first line of the message.
 *  </p>
 *  <pre>
 *     HTTP-Version   = "HTTP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
 *  </pre>
 *  <p>
 *   Note that the major and minor numbers MUST be treated as separate
 *   integers and that each MAY be incremented higher than a single digit.
 *   Thus, HTTP/2.4 is a lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is
 *   lower than HTTP/12.3. Leading zeros MUST be ignored by recipients and
 *   MUST NOT be sent.
 *  </p>

Note that the character entities for less-than and greater-than are not properly
ended with a semi-colon.

I will attach a proposed fix.
