ManageableCollectionUtil doesn't support Maps



Description:
ManageableCollectionUtil has two getManageableCollection methods, which do not currently return a ManageableCollection which wraps Maps. 

ManagedHashMap already exists in the codebase which I assume was created for this purpose, so both getManageableCollection methods could be modified so that they do something like:

            if (object instanceof Map){
                return new ManagedHashMap((Map)object);
            }


An alternative solution might be to modify the JCR mapping to support explicitly defining the 'ManagedXXX' class.
