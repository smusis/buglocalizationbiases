Fix buggy stemmers and Remove duplicate analysis functionality



Description:
would like to remove stemmers in the following packages, and instead in their analyzers use a SnowballStemFilter instead.

* analyzers/fr
* analyzers/nl
* analyzers/ru

below are excerpts from this code where they proudly proclaim they use the snowball algorithm.
I think we should delete all of this custom stemming code in favor of the actual snowball package.

/**
 * A stemmer for French words. 
 * <p>
 * The algorithm is based on the work of
 * Dr Martin Porter on his snowball project<br>
 * refer to http://snowball.sourceforge.net/french/stemmer.html<br>
 * (French stemming algorithm) for details
 * </p>

public class FrenchStemmer {

/**
 * A stemmer for Dutch words. 
 * <p>
 * The algorithm is an implementation of
 * the <a href="http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/dutch/stemmer.html">dutch stemming</a>
 * algorithm in Martin Porter's snowball project.
