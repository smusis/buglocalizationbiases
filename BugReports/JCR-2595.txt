SessionImpl.createSession uses same Subject/LoginContext



Description:
SessionImpl.createSession(String) uses the same loginctx/subject to create a new session.
this will cause problems if Session.logout() is called on the original instance.

i suggest to fix that by creating a new subject for the new session instance.
