Use Maven dependency management



Description:
Many of the Jackrabbit components have dependencies to each other and to external libraries,
whose versions should ideally be the same for all the Jackrabbit components. To guarantee
the use of same depedency versions and to simplify overall depedency management we should
start using the Maven depedencyManagement feature in the Jackrabbit parent pom.
