remove relative paths assumptions from benchmark code

Benchmark's config.xml relies on relative paths, more or less like this;
- base-dir
   -- conf-dir
   -- work-dir
       --- docs-dir
       --- indexes-dir

These assumptions are also in the Java code, and so it is inconvenient for
using absolute paths, e.g. for specifying a docs dir that is not under work-dir.

Relax this by modifying in build.xml to replace "value" and "line" props by 
"location" and "file" and by requiring absolute paths in the Java code.
