Add ability to open prior commits to IndexReader



Description:
If you use a customized DeletionPolicy, which keeps multiple commits
around (instead of the default which is to only preserve the most
recent commit), it's useful to be able to list all such commits and
then open a reader against one of these commits.

I've added this API to list commits:

  public static Collection IndexReader.listCommits(Directory)

and these two new open methods to IndexReader to open a specific commit:

  public static IndexReader open(IndexCommit)
  public static IndexReader open(IndexCommit, IndexDeletionPolicy)

Spinoff from here:
