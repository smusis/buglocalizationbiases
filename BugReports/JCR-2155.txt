SQL2 parser: identifiers should be case sensitive



Description:
Currently the SQL2 parser converts the query to uppercase before parsing. However the identifiers should be kept case sensitive.

Instead of converting the query to uppercase, String.equalsIgnoreCase should be used to compare against keywords.
