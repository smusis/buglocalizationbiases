Use an enumeration for QOM operators



Description:
The PFD version of QueryObjectModelConstants contains some incorrect constant values that make it unusable as a source of operator constants.

Since we are now using Java 5, I propose that instead of adding our own replacement constant strings, we implement a type-safe Operator enumeration that contains fixed versions of all the operator constants declared in QueryObjectModelConstants.
