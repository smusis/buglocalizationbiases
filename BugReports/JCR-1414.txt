Data store garbage collection: inUse not correctly synchronized



Description:
Access to the fields DbDataStore.inUse and FileDataStore.inUse is not synchronized.
This is a problem when concurrently calling GarbageCollector.deleteUnused() 
and accessing the data store (ConcurrentModificationException is thrown).
