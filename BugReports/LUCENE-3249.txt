Move Solr's FunctionQuery impls to Queries Module



Description:
Now that we have the main interfaces in the Queries module, we can move the actual impls over.

Impls that won't be moved are:

function/distance/* (to be moved to a spatial module)
function/FileFloatSource.java (depends on Solr's Schema, data directories and exposes a RequestHandler)
