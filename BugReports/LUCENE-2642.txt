merge LuceneTestCase and LuceneTestCaseJ4



Description:
We added Junit4 support, but as a separate test class.

So unfortunately, we have two separate base classes to maintain: LuceneTestCase and LuceneTestCaseJ4.
This creates a mess and is difficult to manage.

Instead, I propose a single base test class that works both junit3 and junit4 style.

I modified our LuceneTestCaseJ4 in the following way:
* the methods to run are not limited to the ones annotated with @Test, but also any void no-arg methods that start with "test", like junit3. this means you dont have to sprinkle @Test everywhere.
* of course, @Ignore works as expected everywhere.
* LuceneTestCaseJ4 extends TestCase so you dont have to import static Assert.* to get all the asserts.

for most tests, no changes are required. but a few very minor things had to be changed:
* setUp() and tearDown() must be public, not protected.
* useless ctors must be removed, such as TestFoo(String name) { super(name); }
* LocalizedTestCase is gone, instead of
{code}
public class TestQueryParser extends LocalizedTestCase {
{code}
it is now
{code}
@RunWith(LuceneTestCase.LocalizedTestCaseRunner.class)
public class TestQueryParser extends LuceneTestCase {
{code}
* Same with MultiCodecTestCase: (LuceneTestCase.MultiCodecTestCaseRunner.class}

I only did the core tests in the patch as a start, and i just made an empty LuceneTestCase extends LuceneTestCaseJ4.

I'd like to do contrib and solr and rename this LuceneTestCaseJ4 to only a single class: LuceneTestCase.
