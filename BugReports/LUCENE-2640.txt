add LuceneTestCase[J4].newField



Description:
I think it would be good to vary the different field options in tests.

For example, we do this with IW settings (newIndexWriterConfig), and directories (newDirectory).

This patch adds newField(), it works just like new Field(), except it will sometimes turns on extra options:
Stored fields, term vectors, additional term vectors data, etc.
