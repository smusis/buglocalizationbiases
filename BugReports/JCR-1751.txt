Update slf4j



Description:
Please update slf4j from 1.3.0 to 1.5.2.

jcl104-over-slf4j has been renamed as jcl-over-slf4j, so if one uses a recent version, he has to exclude jcl104-over-slf4j for every jackrabbit dependency, which is quite a pain...

No impact observed.

Best regards,

Stephane Landelle
