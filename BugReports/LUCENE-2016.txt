replace invalid U+FFFF character during indexing



Description:
If the invalid U+FFFF character is embedded in a token, it actually causes indexing to silently corrupt the index by writing duplicate terms into the terms dict.  CheckIndex will catch the error, and merging will hit exceptions (I think).

We already replace invalid surrogate pairs with the replacement character U+FFFD, so I'll just do the same with U+FFFF.
