System search manager uses a SessionItemStateManager



Description:
As noted in JCR-2000, the system search manager (responsible for indexing the /jcr:system subtree) uses the SessionItemStateManager instance of the system session instead of the SharedItemStateManager of the underlying default workspace.

This can cause a deadlock (see the thread dumps in JCR-2000) when one thread is accessing the LockManager (that also uses the system session) while another thread is persisting versioning changes.

See the search-on-sism.patch attachment in JCR-2000 for a fix to this issue.
