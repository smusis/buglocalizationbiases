changed behavior of javax.jcr.Value get* methods



Description:
stream handling semantics of javax.jcr.Value has been simplified in JCR 2.0:

Section '5.10.5.1 Deprecated Binary Behavior'

[...]
Unlike in JCR 1.0, calling a get method other than getStream before 
calling getStream on the same Value object will never cause an 
IllegalStateException.
