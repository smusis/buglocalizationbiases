[PATCH] refactor access to SAXParser and log which parser class is used



Description:
This parser collects code that was duplicated in the SessionImpl and WorkspaceImpl class to initialize the SAXParser.

Also, the actual SAXParser class being used is logged (once only) to make it easier to debug problems like JCR-984.
