Support more queries (other than just title) in Trec quality pkg



Description:
Now that we can properly parse descriptions and narratives from TREC queries (LUCENE-2210), it would be nice to allow the user to easily run quality evaluations on more than just "Title"

This patch adds an optional commandline argument to QueryDriver (the default is Title as before), where you can specify something like:
T: Title-only
D: Description-only
N: Narrative-only
TD: Title + Description,
TDN: Title+Description+Narrative,
DN: Description+Narrative

The SimpleQQParser has an additional constructor that simply accepts a String[] of these fields, forming a booleanquery across all of them.
