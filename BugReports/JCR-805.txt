Introduce a temprary cache for intermediate query results



Description:
Sometimes queries execute the same sub query multiple times.

e.g. //element(*, nt:resource)[@jcr:mimeType != 'text/plain' and @jcr:mimeType != 'text/html']

will result in two internal MatchAllQuery on jcr:mimeType. The query should re-use the previously calculated results when possible.
