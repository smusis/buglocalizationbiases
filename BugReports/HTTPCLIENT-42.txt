Open up org.apache.commons.httpclient.Base64 please



Description:
I have had several problems lately where I needed to truck backwards and
forwards between bytes and base64. As I am using HttpClient, I know I have the
code in my proect, but I need to duplicate it into my own heirarchy to get
access rights. 

Please make appropriate changes to Base64 (can be as simple as marking the
encode and decode methods public) to allow outside use of Base64.

Would be nice to extend Base64 to deal with multi-line Base64 content too - but
I know this is outside of Base64 original intended use. But it would be useful. :)
