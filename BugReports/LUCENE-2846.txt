omitTF is viral, but omitNorms is anti-viral.



Description:
omitTF is viral. if you add document 1 with field "foo" as omitTF, then document 2 has field "foo" without omitTF, they are both treated as omitTF.

but omitNorms is the opposite. if you have a million documents with field "foo" with omitNorms, then you add just one document without omitting norms, 
now you suddenly have a million 'real norms'.

I think it would be good for omitNorms to be viral too, just for consistency, and also to prevent huge byte[]'s.
but another option is to make omitTF anti-viral, which is more "schemaless" i guess.
