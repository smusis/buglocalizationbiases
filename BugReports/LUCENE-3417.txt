DictionaryCompoundWordTokenFilter does not properly add tokens from the end compound word.



Description:
Due to an off-by-one error, a subword placed at the end of a compound word will not get a token added to the token stream.


For example (from the unit test in the attached patch):
Dictionary: {"ab", "cd", "ef"}
Input: "abcdef"
Created tokens: {"abcdef", "ab", "cd"}
Expected tokens: {"abcdef", "ab", "cd", "ef"}


Additionally, it could produce tokens that were shorter than the minSubwordSize due to another off-by-one error. For example (again, from the attached patch):


Dictionary: {"abc", "d", "efg"}
Minimum subword length: 2
Input: "abcdefg"
Created tokens: {"abcdef", "abc", "d", "efg"}
Expected tokens: {"abcdef", "abc", "efg"}
