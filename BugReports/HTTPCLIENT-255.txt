In J2SDK 1.5.0 (Tiger) enum is a keyword



Description:
Hi!

Tiger adds extensions to the Java Programming Language (JSR201). One is
"Enumerations", which required to add the new keyword enum.

I just made a grep (grep -lrw) over some sources and found some Apache projects
using enum as a word.

To be compliant with the new specification, please check that enum is not used
as a variable, field or method name.

Regards,
Robert
