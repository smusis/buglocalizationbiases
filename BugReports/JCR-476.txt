Remove recently added getJCRPath()/getQPath() from NamespaceResolver



Description:
issue JCR-473 added 2 new methods to NamespaceResolver: 

    public Path getQPath(String jcrPath) throws MalformedPathException;
    public String getJCRPath(Path qPath) throws NoPrefixDeclaredException;

which do not belong here, since the NamespaceResolver has nothing to do with paths. suggest to remove them.

further is the naming of the QName related methods a bit vague. suggest to rename them to:

   QName parseName(String jcrName)
   String formatName(QName qName)

(although they do not belong here either, but helps to leverage evt. caching namespace resolvers).
