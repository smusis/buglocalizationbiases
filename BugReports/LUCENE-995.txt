Add open ended range query syntax to QueryParser



Description:
The QueryParser fails to generate open ended range queries.
Parsing e.g. "date:[1990 TO *]"  gives zero results,
but
ConstantRangeQuery("date","1990",null,true,true)
does produce the expected results.

"date:[* TO 1990]" gives the same results as ConstantRangeQuery("date",null,"1990",true,true).
