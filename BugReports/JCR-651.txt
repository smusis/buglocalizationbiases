Improve performance for queries with large result sets



Description:
The current implementation of QueryResult requires that access rights are checked on all NodeIds before they are passed ot the QueryResult. This handling should be improved to a more lazy approach where result nodes are checked in configurable batches. Usually a client is only interested in the top scoring results.
