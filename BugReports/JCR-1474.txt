consistency check fails with derbypm if bundle size exceeds 32k



Description:
due to a 'problem' in derby DERBY-1486 interleaved reads on a bundle that is larger than about 32k results in an error:
  ERROR XJ073: The data in this BLOB or CLOB is no longer available.  
               The BLOB or CLOBs transaction may be committed, or its 
               connection is closed.

this issue was already addressed in JCR-1039 but not fixed for the consistency check.
