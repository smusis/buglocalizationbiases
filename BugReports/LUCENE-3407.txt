wrong stats/scoring from MemoryCodec



Description:
I hit some random failures in the flexscoring branch: wierd because its not a random test.

I noticed the test always failed with memorycodec, and wrote a specific test for it.

I haven't traced thru it yet, but I think its likely the issue that memorycodec is somehow returning wrong stats here?
