First Steps document is outdated



Description:
As reported by Manoj Prasad on the development mailing list, the code and configuration shown on the First Steps document [1] is no longer up to date with the latest Jackrabbit sources. The differences are:

   * the Versioning element needs to be added to the repository configuration file
   * the output values printed by the examples have changes (log messages, new node types, etc.)
   * multiple values (especially jcr:mixinTypes properties) are not handled correctly

The document should be updated.
