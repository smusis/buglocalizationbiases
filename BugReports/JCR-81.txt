Implement anonymous login with credentials



Description:
Jackrabbit currently implements anonymous login by detecting a null credentials argument on login. This is actually not compliant to the specification.

<spec>
If credentials is null, it is assumed that authentication is handled by a mechanism external to the repository itself (for example, through the JAAS framework) and that the repository implementation exists within a context (for example, an application server) that allows it to handle authorization of the request for access to the specified workspace.
</spec>

Jackrabbit should rather support anonymous login with a defined credential, either some subclass of SimpleCredentials or a predefined / known userId that has read-only access.
