Redirect and Kerberos authentication in conflict



Description:
We are using the HttpClient to connect to a Website that uses Kerberos-Authentication.

Beware this trigger word: Kerberos! I think this is *not* the problem, but please read on.

Here is the sequence of events:

Client: GET /
Server: Unauthorized.
Client: GET / and includes authentication.
Server: 302 to /something on the same host (this shows that in principle authentication works)
Client: GET /something,  does not include authentication
Server: Unauthorized

Client quits with 401-Unauthorized.

I would have expected one of the following instead:

1) Client immediately sends authorization information with the redirected GET /something
2) Client re-requests the /something with authorization after 401-Unauthorized.

We could get around the problem by setting the ConnectionReuseStrategy to a constant false.

It would be great if someone could tell me if HttpClient works as expected or whether there is a bug or misconfiguration lurking.

Thanks,
Harald.
