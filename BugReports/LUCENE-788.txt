contrib/benchmark assumes Locale.US for parsing dates in Reuters collection



Description:
SimpleDateFormat used for parsing dates in Reuters documents is instantiated without specifying a locale. So it is using the default locale. If that happens to be US, it will work. But for another locale a parse exception is likely.

Affects both StandardBenchmarker and ReutersDocMaker.

Fix is trivial - specify Locale.US for SimpleDateFormat's constructor.
