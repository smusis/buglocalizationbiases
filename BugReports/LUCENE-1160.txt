MergeException from CMS threads should record the Directory



Description:
When you hit an unhandled exception in ConcurrentMergeScheduler, it
throws a MergePolicy.MergeException, but there's no easy way to figure
out which index caused this (if you have more than one).

I plan to add the Directory to the MergeException.  I also made a few
other small changes to ConcurrentMergeScheduler:

  * Added handleMergeException method, which is called on exception,
    so that you can subclass ConcurrentMergeScheduler to do something
    when an exception occurs.

  * Added getMergeThread() method so you can override how the threads
    are created (eg, if you want to make them in a different thread
    group, use a pool, change priorities, etc.).

  * Added doMerge(...) to actually do this merge, so you can do
    something before starting and after finishing a merge.

  * Changed private -> protected on a few attrs

I plan to commit in a day or two.
