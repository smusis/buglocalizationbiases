[PATCH] IndexSearcher.search(query,filter,nDocs) accepts zero nDocs



Description:
This caused an npe from the ht.top().score lateron. 
The root cause was a bug in a test case, which took 
more time to track down than would have been necessary 
with the attached patch. 
The patch throws an IllegalArgumentException for non positive nDocs. 
All current tests pass with the patch applied.
