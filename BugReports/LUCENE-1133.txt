WikipediaTokenizer needs a way of not tokenizing certain parts of the text



Description:
It would be nice if the WikipediaTokenizer had a way of, via a flag, leaving categories, links, etc. as single tokens (or at least some parts of them)

Thus, if we came across [[Category:My Big Idea]] there would be a way of outputting, as a single token "My Big Idea".  

Optionally, it would be good to output both "My Big Idea" and the individual tokens as well.

I am not sure of how to do this in JFlex, so any insight would be appreciated.
