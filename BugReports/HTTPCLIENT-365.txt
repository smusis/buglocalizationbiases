StatusLine IndexOutOfBounds



Description:
Reported by Sam Berlin on the developers mailing list:

I'm not sure if this problem is still on CVS HEAD, but we're seeing it  
against 2.0rc2.  In StatusLine (line 139 in my version), when it walks  
through the spaces, it is possible that the entire line was spaces (and  
thus a malformed response).  The code will throw an  
StringIndexOutOfBoundsException now instead of the correct  
HttpException.  See the following bug:

Thanks,
