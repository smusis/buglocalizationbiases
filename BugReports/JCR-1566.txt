Data Store: DB2 fails to create the table



Description:
DB2 throws an exception(1) when creating the table. The correct SQL sentence to create it is:
createTable=CREATE TABLE ${tablePrefix}${table}(ID VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, LENGTH BIGINT, LAST_MODIFIED BIGINT, DATA BLOB(1000M))
(1): Sorry but I don't have the exception information since I made this change a few weeks ago.
