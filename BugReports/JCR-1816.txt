Provide more options for OCM CRUD API Writers to enhance the functionality



Description:
I am working on an Extension to Object Content Manager and from that angle require a few methods and variable from the base classes to be exposed with protected access.  I have modifier only the getters and these should not cause any issues to the current functionality.  Request a review and addition to the trunk.  

1. added a clone implementation to FilterImpl
2.  Exposed : 
public CollectionConverter getCollectionConverter(Session session, CollectionDescriptor collectionDescriptor) from ObjectConverter
