FileInputStream never closed in HTMLParser



Description:
HTMLParser.java contains this code: 
 
  public HTMLParser(File file) throws FileNotFoundException { 
    this(new FileInputStream(file)); 
  } 
 
This FileInputStream should be closed with the close() method, as there's no 
guarantee that the garbage collection will run and do this for you. I don't 
know how to fix this without changing the API to take a FileInputStream 
instead of a File, as the call to this() must be the first thing in the 
constructor, i.e. you cannot create the stream, call this(...), and then close 
the stream.
