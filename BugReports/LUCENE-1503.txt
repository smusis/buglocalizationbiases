refactor spatial contrib "Filter" "Query" classes



Description:
From erik's comments in LUCENE-1387

    * DistanceQuery is awkwardly named. It's not an (extends) Query.... it's a POJO with helpers. Maybe DistanceQueryFactory? (but it creates a Filter also)

    * CartesianPolyFilter is not a Filter (but CartesianShapeFilter is)
