AccessControlProvider#getEffectivePolicies for a set of principals does not include repo-level ac



Description:
as of JCR-2774 the resource based ac implementation allows to edit permissions for repository level operations.
however, ACLProvider#getEffectivePolicies(Set<Principal>, CompiledPermissions) does not include the repo level AC
in the result set due to a missing test for regular acl OR repo-level acl.
