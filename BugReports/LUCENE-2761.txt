specialize payload processing from of DocsAndPositionsEnum



Description:
In LUCENE-2760 i started working to try to improve the speed of a few spanqueries.
In general the trick there is to avoid processing positions if you dont have to.

But, we can improve queries that read lots of positions further by cleaning up SegmentDocsAndPositionsEnum, 
in nextPosition() this has no less than 3 payloads-related checks.

however, a large majority of users/fields have no payloads at all.
I think we should specialize this case into a separate implementation and speed up the common case.

edit: dyslexia with the jira issue number.
