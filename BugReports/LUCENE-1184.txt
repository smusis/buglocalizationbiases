Allow SnapshotDeletionPolicy to be reused across writer close/open



Description:
If you re-use the same instance of SnapshotDeletionPolicy across a
close/open of your writer, and you had a snapshot open, it can still
be removed when the 2nd writer is opened.  This is because SDP is
comparing IndexCommitPoint instances.

The fix is to instead compare segments file names.

I've also changed the inner class IndexFileDeleter.CommitPoint to be
static so an instance of SnapshotDeletionPolicy does not hold
references to IndexFileDeleter, DocumentsWriter, etc.
