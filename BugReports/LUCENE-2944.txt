BytesRef reuse bugs in QueryParser and analysis.jsp



Description:
Some code uses BytesRef as if it were a "String", in this case consumers of TermToBytesRefAttribute.
The thing is, while our general implementation works on char[] and then populates the consumers BytesRef,
not all TermToBytesRefAttribute implementations do this, specifically ICU collation, it reuses the bytes and simply sets the pointers:
{noformat}
  @Override
  public int toBytesRef(BytesRef target) {
    collator.getRawCollationKey(toString(), key);
    target.bytes = key.bytes;
    target.offset = 0;
    target.length = key.size;
    return target.hashCode();
  }
{noformat}

Most of the blame falls on me as I added this to the queryparser in LUCENE-2514.

Attached is a patch so that these consumers re-use a 'spare' and copy the bytes when they are going to make a long lasting object such as a Term.
