CooperativeFileLock improvements



Description:
The CooperativeFileLock doesn't have any test cases. Also, there are a few ways to improve it:

- Avoid the exception "lock file modified in the future"
- Stop the thread immediately after releasing the lock
- Detect locked repositories a bit earlier
