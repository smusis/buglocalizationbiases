Remove noLockHack in SharedItemStateManager



Description:
With the increased test coverage, specifically the recently added multi-threaded tests, I'm reasonably confident that the noLockHack in SharedItemStateManager is not needed anymore.

Attached patch removes the hack. All tests still pass, including the daily integration tests.
