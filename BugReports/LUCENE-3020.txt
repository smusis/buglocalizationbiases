better payload testing with mockanalyzer



Description:
MockAnalyzer currently always indexes some fixed-length payloads.

Instead it should decide for each field randomly (and remember it for that field):
* if the field should index no payloads at all
* field should index fixed length payloads
* field should index variable length payloads.
