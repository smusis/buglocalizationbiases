activity storage path



Description:
JSR-283 states in 15.12.3:

"15.12.3 Activity Storage
Activities are persisted as nodes of type nt:activity under system-generated
node names in activity storage below /jcr:system/jcr:activities."

As far as I can tell, this is currently not the case.

A related test case, org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.version.ActivitiesTest#testActivitiesPath, apparently was taken out accidentally.

If Jackrabbit can't implement this JCR requirement, we either need to document it, or raise it as issue in the JCR Expert Group.
