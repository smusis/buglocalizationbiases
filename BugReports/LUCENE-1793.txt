remove custom encoding support in Greek/Russian Analyzers



Description:
The Greek and Russian analyzers support custom encodings such as KOI-8, they define things like Lowercase and tokenization for these.

I think that analyzers should support unicode and that conversion/handling of other charsets belongs somewhere else. 

I would like to deprecate/remove the support for these other encodings.
