SQL-2 query returns more than the requested column



Description:
If I do :

SELECT alias.[jcr:title] FROM [jnt:mainContent] as alias

and then iterate through the returned columns of the rows, I get the same result as for :

SELECT * FROM [jnt:mainContent] 

which is ALL the properties defined for jnt:mainContent.

Only if I use

SELECT alias.[jcr:title] as title FROM [jnt:mainContent] as alias

the result is limited to the title column.
