Problem with formerly escaped JCR node names when upgrading to Jackrabbit 2.2.9



Description:
The following unit test fails:

{code}
import static org.junit.Assert.*;

import org.apache.jackrabbit.util.Text;
import org.junit.Test;

public class TestEscaping
{
   @Test
   public void testEscaping() throws Exception
   {
      // expect this as an escaped string (e.g. formerly escaped with jackrabbit 1.6)
      String escaped = "nam%27e";
      String unescaped = Text.unescapeIllegalJcrChars(escaped);
      assertEquals(escaped, Text.escapeIllegalJcrChars(unescaped));
   }
}
{code}

This is a major problem when upgrading from 1.6.x to 2.2.9. The node names that were escaped in jackrabbit 1.6 are not longer escaped and that breaks the backward compatibility. I think the problem comes in with JCR-2198.
