Document is partially indexed on an unhandled exception



Description:
With LUCENE-843, it's now possible for a subset of a document's
fields/terms to be indexed or stored when an exception is hit.  This
was not the case in the past (it was "all or none").

I plan to make it "all or none" again by immediately marking a
document as deleted if any exception is hit while indexing it.

Discussion leading up to this:
