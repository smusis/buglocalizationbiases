[PATCH] XPathQueryBuilder reports misleading column numbers for faulty queries



Description:
XPathQueryBuilder returns an error string with the column offset where a parsing error occurred. Unfortunately this value is difficult to correlate to the users query string, as XPathQueryBuilder embellishes the query by doing

statement = "for $v in " + statement + " return $v";

This patch appends the modified statement to the query message so that the user can get the real position of the error.
