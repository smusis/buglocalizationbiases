SPI: change param order with RepositoryService.createBatch



Description:
all methods on RepositoryService that require a SessionInfo list the info as first parameter, except for 

RepositoryService.createBatch(ItemId, SessionInfo) 

unless someone objects i would refacter the method signature for consistency reasons.

new:

RepositoryService.createBatch(SessionInfo, ItemId)
