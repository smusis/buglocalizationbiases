Avoid item state reads during Session.logout()



Description:
Local item states are discarded during Session.logout(). Currently the CachingHierarchyManager is still registered as a item state listener at that time and will cause numerous ItemStateManager.hasItemState() calls. This is unnecessary and just adds overhead to the logout call. In addition it will also contribute to a potential lock contention on the SharedItemStateManager.
