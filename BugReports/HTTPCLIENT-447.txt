IllegalStateException: Authentication state already initialized



Description:
Hi,

I am running HttpClient 3.0 RC2 in my application and a user send me a logfile
telling "IllegalStateException: Authentication state already initialized". 

He wanted to access a site on SUN.com and is behind a proxy. The site seems to
redirect to a different domain.

I have attached a Debug+Trace HttpClient log.

Ben
