DefaultMethodRetryHandler bug



Description:
DefaultMethodRetryHandler does not seem to test correctly for the number of
attempts to retry a given method. It seems to bail out one attempt too early:

if (executionCount >= this.retryCount) {
  // Do not retry if over max retry count
  return false;
}

For example, if I set the retryCount to 1, HttpClient does not retry the method
at all. At least that's what I'm seeing when I step through it with a debugger.
