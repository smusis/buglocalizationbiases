Make Jackrabbit compile on Java 7



Description:
Compiling on Java 7 fails with the following error:

    jackrabbit-core/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/util/db/DataSourceWrapper.java:[30,7] error:
    DataSourceWrapper is not abstract and does not override abstract method getParentLogger() in CommonDataSource

We should fix that.
