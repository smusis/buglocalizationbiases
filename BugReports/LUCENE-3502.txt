Packed ints: move .getArray into Reader API



Description:
This is a simple code cleanup... it's messy that a consumer of
PackedInts.Reader must check whether the impl is Direct8/16/32/64 in
order to get an array; it's better to move up the .getArray into the
Reader interface and then make the DirectN impls package private.
