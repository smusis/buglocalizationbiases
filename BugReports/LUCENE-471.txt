gcj ant target doesn't work on windows



Description:
In order to fix it I made two changes, both really simple.

First I added to org/apache/lucene/store/GCJIndexInput.cc some code to use windows memory-mapped I/O instead than unix mmap().

Then I had to rearrange the link order in the Makefile in order to avoid unresolved symbol errors. Also to build repeatedly I had to instruct make to ignore the return code for the mkdir command as on windows it fails if the directory already exists.

I'm attaching two patches corresponding to the changes; please note that with the patches applied, the gcj target still works on linux. Both patches apply cleanly to the current svn head.
