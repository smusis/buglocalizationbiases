[JCR-RMI] Have ClientItem.isSame throw RepositoryException



Description:
Currently the ClientItem.isSame(Item) method wraps a RepositoryException thrown from the path comparison into a RuntimeException and omits an exception declaration on the method. This contrasts with the API specification which allows for a RepositoryExcption to be thrown.

I suggest, to modify ClientItem.isSame(Item) such that the RepositoryException is declared and thrown.
