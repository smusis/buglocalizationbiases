Improve the use of isDeleted in the indexing code



Description:
A spin off from here: http://www.nabble.com/Some-thoughts-around-the-use-of-reader.isDeleted-and-hasDeletions-td23931216.html.
Two changes:
# Optimize SegmentMerger work when a reader has no deletions.
# IndexReader.document() will no longer check if the document is deleted.

Will post a patch shortly
