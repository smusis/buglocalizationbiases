allow automatontermsenum to work on full byte range



Description:
AutomatonTermsEnum is really agnostic to whats in your byte[], only that its in binary order.
so if you wanted to use this on some non-utf8 terms, thats just fine.

the patch just does some code cleanup and removes "utf8" references, etc.
additionally i changed the pkg-private, lucene-internal byte-oriented ctor, to public, lucene.experimental.
