Add support for ICU's Normalizer2



Description:
While there are separate Case Folding, Normalization, and Ignorable-removal filters in LUCENE-1488,
the new ICU Normalizer2 API does this all at once with nfkc_cf (based on the new NFKC_Casefold property in Unicode).

This is great, because it provides a ton of unicode functionality that is really needed.
And the new Normalizer2 API takes CharSequence and writes to Appendable...
