Avoid path resolution in case of non-wildcard ACEs (follow-up to JCR-2573)



Description:
adding the ability to specify wildcard-ac-entries in the default resource based access control management lead to
always resolving the id passed to AccessControlProvider#canRead in order to be able to properly evaluate
any wildcard-aces present.

this could be improved with minor refactoring that postpones the path resolution and omitting it if there are no
wildcard-aces to compare with.
