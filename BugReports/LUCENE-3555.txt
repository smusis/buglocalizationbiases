Add support for distributed stats



Description:
(its a bug in a way, since we broke this, temporarily).

There is no way to do this now (distributed IDF, etc) with the new API.

But we should do it right:
* having the sim ask the searcher for docfreq of a term is wasteful and dangerous, 
  usually we have already seek'd to the term and already collected the 'raw' stuff.
* the situation is more than just docfreq, because you should be able to implement
  distributed scoring for all of the new sim models (or your own), that use any
  of Lucene's stats.
