AbstractRecord does inefficient List.indexOf()



Description:
AbstractRecord keeps a list of already used UUIDs and references
them by index when used again in a record. Using a List does not
scale well, when the record grows larger. e.g. a transaction of
10k nodes takes more than a minute on my machine when the journal
is enabled. Most of the time is spent doing List.indexOf() in
AbstractRecord.getOrCreateIndex().
