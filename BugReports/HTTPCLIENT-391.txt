Deprecate and replace TestWebapp with the SimpleHttpServer based testing framework



Description:
Basically TestWebapp based testcases test functionality of Tomcat, rather than
that of HttpClient. They tend to get broken with every major release of Tomcat
and have proven more of a burden than any good
