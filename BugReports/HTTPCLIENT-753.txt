move class Scheme and friends to a separate package



Description:
We currently have a recursive dependency between packages o.a.h.conn and o.a.h.conn.routing, because routing depends on Scheme/SchemeRegistry. While these classes are used throughout the connection management code, they are not really part of the connection management itself and would therefore fit nicely into a separate package.

preliminary list of classes and interfaces to move:
- Scheme
- SchemeRegistry
- SocketFactory
- LayeredSocketFactory
- PlainSocketFactory

suggested package name: o.a.h.conn.scheme

Package o.a.h.conn.ssl can stay where it is, it only changes its dependency from conn to the new package.

cheers,
