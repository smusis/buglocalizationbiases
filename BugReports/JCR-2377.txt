Avoid docFreq calls for non-fulltext queries



Description:
Looking up the document frequency for a query terms costs I/O and is only useful for fulltext queries (-> the document frequency has an influence on the relevance of a result node). Simple constraints like: @foo = 'bar' may return a constant value for docFreq.
