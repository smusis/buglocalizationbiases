WorkspaceRestoreTest extends RestoreTest



Description:
WorkspaceRestoreTest extends RestoreTest in order to re-use variables and setUp/tearDown code. 

On the other hand, this causes all tests from RestoreTest that aren't overriden by WorkspaceRestoreTest to be run twice.

Proposal: decouple the classes, copying over the interesting parts from RestoreTest into WorkspaceRestoreTest.
