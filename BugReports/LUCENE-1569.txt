IndexReader.clone can leave files open



Description:
I hit this in working on LUCENE-1516.

When not using compound file format, if you clone an IndexReader, then close the original, then close the clone, the stored fields files (_X.fdt, _X.fdx) remain incorrectly open.

I have a test showing it; fix is trivial.  Will post patch & commit shortly.
