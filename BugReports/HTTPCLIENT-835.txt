Thread safety and visibility Improvements



Description:
AbstractAuthenticationHandler.DEFAULT_SCHEME_PRIORITY is not protected against external changes.

Although the field is private, subclasses can obtain a reference to it and so may be able to change it.

Consider making the list read-only, or returning a copy instead.
