Replace license headers with new policy text



Description:
We need to replace all of the license headers with a new template
that replaces the Copyright and license lines with

---BEGIN PROPOSED SOURCE FILE HEADER---

  contributor license agreements.  The ASF licenses this file to You

---END PROPOSED SOURCE FILE HEADER---

The copyright line is being removed from files due to legal advice from ASF attorneys.
It is replaced with a statement that the copyright owners have licensed it to the ASF.
