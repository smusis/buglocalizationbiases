NRTCachingDirectory, to buffer small segments in a RAMDir



Description:
I created this simply Directory impl, whose goal is reduce IO
contention in a frequent reopen NRT use case.

The idea is, when reopening quickly, but not indexing that much
content, you wind up with many small files created with time, that can
possibly stress the IO system eg if merges, searching are also
fighting for IO.

So, NRTCachingDirectory puts these newly created files into a RAMDir,
and only when they are merged into a too-large segment, does it then
write-through to the real (delegate) directory.

This lets you spend some RAM to reduce I0.
