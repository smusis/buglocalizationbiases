Provide more Example Code



Description:
- better project samples showing how to use HttpClient in a variety of ways. 
There is already a src/examples directory which is excellent.  Its in the right
place and should be build with a full compile, if only to know how any API
changes may effect example code, and that we will be required to keep them
current.
- make sure it uses the 2.0 API and no depricated methods!
