Include diagnostics per-segment when writing a new segment



Description:
It would be very helpful if each segment in an index included
diagnostic information, such as the current version of Lucene.

EG, in LUCENE-1474 this would be very helpful to see if certain
segments were written under 2.4.0.

We can start with just the current version.

We could also consider making this extensible, so you could provide
your own arbitrary diagnostics, but SegmentInfo/s is not public so I
think such an API would be "one-way" in that you'd have to use
CheckIndex to check on it later.  Or we could wait on such extensibility
until we provide some consistent way to access per-segment details
in the index.
