Instantiated/IndexWriter discrepanies



Description:
 * RAMDirectory seems to do a reset on tokenStreams the first time, this permits to initialise some objects before starting streaming, InstantiatedIndex does not.
 * I can Serialize a RAMDirectory but I cannot on a InstantiatedIndex because of : java.io.NotSerializableException: org.apache.lucene.index.TermVectorOffsetInfo
