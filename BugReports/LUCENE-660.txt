GData html render preview



Description:
GData output is usually ATOM / RSS e.g plain xml. This feature enables users or admins to preview the server output as html transformed by user defined xsl stylesheet. Stylesheet is configurable per service.

That's just a cool feature for developing and for users wanna use the server for simple blog or feed server.
