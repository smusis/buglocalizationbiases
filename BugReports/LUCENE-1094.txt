Exception in DocumentsWriter.addDocument can corrupt stored fields file (fdt)



Description:
DocumentsWriter writes the number of stored fields, up front, into the
fdtLocal buffer.  Then, as each field is processed, it writes each
stored field into this buffer.  When the document is done, in a
finally clause, it flushes the buffer to the real fdt file in the
Directory.

The problem is, if an exception is hit, that number of stored fields
can be too high, which corrupts the fdt file.

The solution is to not write it up front, and instead write only the
number of fields we actually saw.
