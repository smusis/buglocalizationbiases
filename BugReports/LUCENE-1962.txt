Persian Arabic Analyzer cleanup



Description:
While browsing through the code I found some places for minor improvements in the new Arabic / Persian Analyzer code. 

- prevent default stopwords from being loaded each time a default constructor is called
- replace if blocks with a single switch
- marking private members final where needed
- changed protected visibility to final in final class.
