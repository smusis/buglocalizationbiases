spi2davex: clear uri-lookup after removing node identified with uniqueID



Description:
some test cases of DocumentViewImportTest fail in the setup (line 325 of AbstractImportXmlTest) since the uri resolved from the specified
nodeID still refers to the node removed during the initial import before. this would equally cause problems whenever a referenceable node was
replaced by another node and can easily be fixed by clearing the uri-cache after the removal as it was already done for move.
