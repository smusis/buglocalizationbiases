spi2davex: Batch fails to create/modify properties with non-ascii characters names



Description:
the spi2davex batch implementation fails upon creation/modification of all property types that have their value sent as
separate stringpart or binarypart AND contain non-ascii characters in their property name.

from what i've seen this is due to a limitation in HttpClient 3.x Part#sendDispositionHeader that always writes the part name
as ascii-bytes. in a related discussion [1] specification compliance and usability were addressed.

looking at the server-side part revealed that org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUploadBase#FileItemIteratorImpl
is prepared to receive non-ascii characters in a header value.
a simple test also showed that curl is perfectly able to send utf-8 part names.

based on this information and given the fact that spi2dav and the server-sided part are intended to communicate
with one other rather than with any kind of custom clients, i suggest to add a simple fix by patching the parts used
within spi2davex.

btw: in HttpClient 4.x there seems to be a workaround for this problem [2]
