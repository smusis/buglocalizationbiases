JavaDoc getConnection methods in Connection Managers



Description:
The JavaDoc for the getConnection() methods in the Simple and MultiThreaded
Connection managers is taken from the interface, and so is too generic.

The Javadoc for the doGetConnection() method in the MultiThreaded manager is
fine, but is not visible in the JavaDoc

The Simple Mangager JavaDoc could likewise be improved

[I hope to provide patches shortly]
