o.a.jackrabbit.spi.commons.conversion.NameParser should not assume that namespace URI's are registered



Description:
according to JCR 2.0, "3.4.3.4 Parsing Lexical Paths":

<quote>
An otherwise valid path containing an expanded name with an unregistered 
namespace URI will always resolve into a valid internal representation of a path 
</quote>

the current implementation assumes that namespace URIs encountered in 
expanded form names are registered, otherwise the name is treated as
qualified name.
