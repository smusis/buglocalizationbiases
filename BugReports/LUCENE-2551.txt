change jdk & icu collation to use byte[]



Description:
Now that term is byte[], we should switch collation to use byte[] instead of 'indexablebinarystring'.

This is faster and results in much smaller sort keys.

I figure we can work it out here, and fix termrangequery to use byte in parallel, but we can already test sorting etc now.
