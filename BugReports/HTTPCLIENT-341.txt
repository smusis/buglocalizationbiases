HttpUrl does not accept unescaped passwords



Description:
- Taken from an email from Gustav Munkby posted to the HttpClient dev mailing list -

If I do:

HTTPUrl url = new HTTPUrl("kurt", "nicepass#", hostname, 80, path);

throws a URIException with message "port number invalid".

First of all the message is wrong...

Next attempt was to urlencode the password, which resulted in the above line working, but the 
password was sent url-encoded to the destination, which can hardly be the desired behaviour?
