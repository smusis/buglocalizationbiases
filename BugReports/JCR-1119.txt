SimpleFieldsHelper emits a lot warnings



Description:
The SimpleFieldsHelper.retrieveSimpleField method is used to load JCR properties into simple Java object fields according to the mapping descriptor. If the node does not have the named property, a WARN message is emited.

If the missing property is defined as optional in the node type definition, it is quite normal, that it may be missing. Therefore emitting a WARN message does not seem appropriate. It would be better, to do the following (in order):

   If the missing property is declared to be required in the descriptor, throw an exception
   else if the descriptor has a default value for the missing property, use that value
   else if the property is defined with a default value in the node type definition, use that value
   else emit a DEBUG message and leave the field undefined

Not sure, whether it makes absolute sense to define a property as mandatory in the descriptor but not in the node type definition. Are there any opinions on that ?
