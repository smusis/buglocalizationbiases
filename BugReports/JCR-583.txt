TCK: NodeReadMethodsTest.testGetName fails with NPE if  'testroot' has no child node



Description:
The 'testGetName' does not assert, that  the childnode field has been populated during setup.
if  for whatever reason  the test data don't provide a single childnode below the test root, this test will fail with nullpointer
exception.

i would like to suggest to use the same assertion as in testGetPath and throw a NotExecutableException in case of
missing child node.

patch attached.
