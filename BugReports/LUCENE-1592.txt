fix or deprecate TermsEnum.skipTo



Description:
This method is a trap: it looks legitimate but it has hideously poor performance (simple linear scan implemented in the TermsEnum base class since none of the concrete impls override it with a more efficient implementation).

The least we should do for 2.9 is deprecate the method with  a strong warning about its performance.
