MultiStatus response for PROPPATCH (copied from JCR-175)

--------------------------------------------------

doPropPatch in AbstractWebdavServlet still needs to send back a multistatus (207) response even in the successful case.

I didn't see a way to collect the success/failure status for each property, but instead created a multistatus response and added a propstat (SC_OK) for each of the properties in the setProperties and removeProperties. This allowed a WebDAV client, which expected a multistatus response from PROPPATCH, to work correctly with jcr-server. In the more general case the actual property status code will need to be used .
