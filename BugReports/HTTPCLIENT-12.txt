double encoding of URLs



Description:
In HttpMethodBase.generateRequestLine(HttpConnection connection, String name, 
String reqPath, String qString, String protocol)

the path is always encoded using URIUtil.encode(reqPath,URIUtil.pathSafe()). 
However, if the path already contains an encoding space, i.e. %20, the % will 
be encoded again, so we get %2520. This behavior is not correct. We shouldn't 
encode any % signs.
