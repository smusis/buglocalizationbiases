Initial post:
Based on the recent URI discussion, and some other points, it strikes me that we
could take a little more credit for the work that has gone into HttpClient.

On the HttpClient home page
(http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/index.html) four RFCs are listed.

Given all the discussion about URIs being thrown around, I think it might be
reasonable to add RFC 2396 - for URI compliance.  Then there is RFC 1867, for
multipart/form-data POST requests (I think I got the right number there).  Are
there RFCs corresponding to our "cookie" compliance? Any other RFCs we can claim
credit for conforming to?

With the recent "Protocol" changes, I think we've made it relatively
straightforward for clients of HttpClient to plug in their own secure sockets
implementations, making it easier to use third party, non-Sun solutions.
