improve test coverage of multi-segment indices



Description:
Simple patch that adds a test-only helper class, RandomIndexWriter, that lets you add docs, but it will randomly do things like use a different merge policy/scheduler, flush by doc count instead of RAM, flush randomly (so we get multi-segment indices) but also randomly optimize in the end (so we also sometimes test single segment indices).
