need a way to set time out when using HttpClient and HttpMultiClient



Description:
When using class HttpClient or HttpMultiClient, there is no way to set the time 
out value. Because the setTimeout method is in HttpConnection and HttpClient or 
HttpMultiClient doesn't expose the HttpConnection object. One option is to add 
a method setTimeout in HttpClient and HttpMultiClient. Another option is to add 
such a method in HttpMethod.
