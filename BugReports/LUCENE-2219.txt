improve BaseTokenStreamTestCase to test end()



Description:
If offsetAtt/end() is not implemented correctly, then there can be problems with highlighting: see LUCENE-2207 for an example with CJKTokenizer.

In my opinion you currently have to write too much code to test this.

This patch does the following:
* adds optional Integer finalOffset (can be null for no checking) to assertTokenStreamContents
* in assertAnalyzesTo, automatically fill this with the String length()

In my opinion this is correct, for assertTokenStreamContents the behavior should be optional, it may not even have a Tokenizer. If you are using assertTokenStreamContents with a Tokenizer then simply provide the extra expected value to check it.

for assertAnalyzesTo then it is implied there is a tokenizer so it should be checked.

the tests pass for core but there are failures in contrib even besides CJKTokenizer (apply Koji's patch from LUCENE-2207, it is correct). Specifically ChineseTokenizer has a similar problem.
