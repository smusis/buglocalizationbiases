XPath query with negative numbers incorrect



Description:
A XPath query that contains a negative number does not return correct results.

E.g. the query:

//*[@number = -10]

does not return nodes with number properties containing a value of -10 but will return nodes with number values equal to 10. Similarly the query returns wrong results for double values.
