speed up core tests



Description:
Our core tests have gotten slower and slower, if you don't have a really fast computer its probably frustrating.

I think we should:
1. still have random parameters, but make the 'obscene' settings like SimpleText rarer... we can always make them happen more on NIGHTLY
2. tests that make a lot of documents can conditionalize on NIGHTLY so that they are still doing a reasonable test on ordinary runs e.g. numdocs = (NIGHTLY ? 10000 : 1000) * multiplier
3. refactor some of the slow huge classes with lots of tests like TestIW/TestIR, at least pull out really slow methods like TestIR.testDiskFull into its own class. this gives better parallelization.
