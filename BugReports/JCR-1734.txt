Generated cluster node id should be persisted



Description:
If no cluster node id is specified in the configuration, a cluster node id is automatically generated. This id is never persisted, so after another startup a new, probably different cluster node id is used. Instead, an automatically generated cluster id should be persisted inside the repository home.
