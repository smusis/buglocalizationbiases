SetCookie / DateParser failing to parse non-standard date format



Description:
I'm receiving the following expiration date in SetCookie which DateParser 
doesn't handle:

expires=Sat,19-Apr-03 04:28:07 GMT

The lack of a space between ',' and '19' is causing the problem. Is it possible 
to add the following lines to DatePattern?

"EEE,dd-MMM-yy HH:mm:ss z"
"EEE,dd-MMM-yyyy HH:mm:ss z"
