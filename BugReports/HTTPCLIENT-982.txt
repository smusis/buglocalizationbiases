Could we get a way to know if the response has been served from the cache or not ?



Description:
Is there a way to know if the response has been served from the cache or not ?
That's an information which might be useful for monitoring the activity of the cache.

If there's no current way, maybe a flag could be added in the request context whenever the response comes from the cache ... ?
