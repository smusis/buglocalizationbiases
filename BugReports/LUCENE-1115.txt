Some small fixes to contrib/benchmark



Description:
I've fixed a few small issues I've hit in contrib/benchmark.

First, this alg was only doing work on the first round.  All
subsequent rounds immediately finished:

{code}
analyzer=org.apache.lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer
doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.LineDocMaker
work.dir = /lucene/work
docs.file=work/reuters.lines.txt
doc.maker.forever=false
directory=FSDirectory
doc.add.log.step=3000

{ "Rounds"
  ResetSystemErase
  CreateIndex
  { "AddDocs" AddDoc > : *
  CloseIndex
  NewRound
} : 3
{code}

I think this is because we are failing to reset "exhausted" to false
in PerfTask.doLogic(), so I added that.  Plus I had to re-open the
file in LineDocMaker.

Second, I made a small optimization to not call updateExhausted unless
any of the child tasks are TaskSequence or ResetInputsTask (which I
compute up-front).

Finally, we were not allowing flushing by RAM and doc count, so I
fixed the logic in Create/OpenIndexTask to set both RAMBufferSizeMB
and MaxBufferedDocs.
