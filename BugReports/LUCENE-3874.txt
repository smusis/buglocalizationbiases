bogus positions create a corrumpt index



Description:
Its pretty common that positionIncrement can overflow, this happens really easily 
if people write analyzers that don't clearAttributes().

It used to be the case that if this happened (and perhaps still is in 3.x, i didnt check),
that IW would throw an exception.

But i couldnt find the code checking this, I wrote a test and it makes a corrumpt index...
