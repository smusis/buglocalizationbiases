Search with sort fails when a document has a missing value



Description:
Testing on version: lucene-1.4-rc2

Call in question: IndexSearcher.search(Query query, Filter filter, int nDocs, 
Sort sort) 

Description: I'm making a call to search with a sort field - in my case I'm 
sorting by date. If any document in the results set (Hits) has a missing value 
in the sort field, the entire call throws an [uncaught] exception during the 
sorting process with no results returned. 

This is an undesireable result, and the prospects for patching this problem 
outside the search classes are ugly, e.g. trying to patch the index itself.

This is actually a critical function in my application. Thank you for 
addressing it.
