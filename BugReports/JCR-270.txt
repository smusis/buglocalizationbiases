Importer drops jcr:xmlcharacters fields after a large jcr:xmlcharacters entry



Description:
If you have an XML node as follows:

<a>
[lots and lots of data]
</a>

This should translate into

Node: a
 +- Node: jcr:xmltext
   +- Property: jcr:xmlcharacters = [lots and lots of data]

Instead, the following things happen:
- There is no node jcr:xmltext
- If the node a has child nodes, they also lose the jcr:xmltext node
- Any nodes on the same level after node a also lose the jcr:xmltext node
- Nodes that come after a, but are on a higher level, have correct jcr:xmltext 
nodes

(I've used some 100+k of data, namely a base64 encoded picture)
