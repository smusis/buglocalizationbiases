TestBasicCookieAttribHandlers fails on non-english Locale systems



Description:
The Test checks for written dates in the format for cookies which unfortunately includes a two character abbreviation of the day. This differs by locale, so the dateformat has to be constructed with Locale.US (as in DateUtils)
