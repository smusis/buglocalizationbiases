NativeFSLockFactory throws an exception on Android 2.2 platform as java.lang.management package is not available on android.



Description:
NativeFSLockFactory throws an exception on Android 2.2 platform as java.lang.management package is not available on android.
   Looks like FSDirectory defaults to NativeFSLockFactory, and this class refers to java.lang.management package to generate a unique lock. java.lang.management is not available in Android 2.2 and hence a runtime exception is raised. The workaround is to use another custom LockFactory or SimpleFSLockFactory, but Fixing NativeFSLockFactroy will help.

Thanks,
