Support unicode escapes in QueryParser



Description:
As suggested by Yonik in http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-573 the QueryParser should be able to handle unicode escapes, i. e. \uXXXX.

I have already working and tested code. It is based on the patch i submitted for LUCENE-573, so once this is (hopefully ;-)) committed, I will submit another patch here.
