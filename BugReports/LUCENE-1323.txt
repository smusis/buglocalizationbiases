MultiReader should make a private copy of the subReaders array



Description:
Spinoff from here:

Because MultiReader just holds a reference to the array that was passed in, it's possible to hit scary exceptions (that look like index corruption) if that array is later altered eg by reopening some of the readers.

The fix is trivial: just make a private copy.
