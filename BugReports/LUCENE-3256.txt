Consolidate CustomScoreQuery, ValueSourceQuery and BoostedQuery 



Description:
Lucene's CustomScoreQuery and Solr's BoostedQuery do essentially the same thing: they boost the scores of Documents by the value from a ValueSource.  BoostedQuery does this in a direct fashion, by accepting a ValueSource. CustomScoreQuery on the other hand, accepts a series of ValueSourceQuerys.  ValueSourceQuery seems to do exactly the same thing as FunctionQuery.

With Lucene's ValueSource being deprecated / removed, we need to resolve these dependencies and simplify the code.

Therefore I recommend we do the following things:

- Move CustomScoreQuery (and CustomScoreProvider) to the new Queries module and change it over to use FunctionQuerys instead of ValueSourceQuerys.  
- Deprecate Solr's BoostedQuery in favour of the new CustomScoreQuery.  CSQ provides a lot of support for customizing the scoring process.
- Move and consolidate all tests of CSQ and BoostedQuery, to the Queries module and have them test CSQ instead.
