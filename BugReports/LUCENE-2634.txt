IndexReader.isCurrent() lies if documents were only removed by latest commit



Description:
Usecase is as following:

1. Get indexReader via indexWriter.
2. Delete documents by Term via indexWriter. 
3. Commit indexWriter.
4. indexReader.isCurrent() returns true.

Usually there is a check if index reader is current. If not then it is reopened (re-obtained via writer or ect.). But this causes the problem when documents can still be found through the search after deletion.
Testcase is attached.
