Allow to configure DB persistence managers through JDNI



Description:
Currently, DB persistence managers have hardcoded urls. Even more, they will use a single connection with the drawbacks that this have regarding concurrency, performance and transactionality. 

It would be fairly better to allow to configure DB persistence managers through JDNI references to DataSource. So giving responsability to application server. Concurrency, performance and transactionability will be highly boosted with this approach. 

This could be a sample configuration :

<PersistenceManager class="org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.db.SimpleDbPersistenceManager">
       <param name="dataSource" value="jdbc/JackrabbitDS"/>

        
       .... think also about a way to pass params to data source, it should be simple ....

       <param name="schema" value="mysql"/>
       <param name="schemaObjectPrefix" value="${
wsp.name}_"/>
       <param name="externalBLOBs" value="false"/>
   </PersistenceManager>
