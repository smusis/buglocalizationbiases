DateTools.stringToDate() can cause lock contention under load



Description:
Load testing our application (the JIRA Issue Tracker) has shown that threads spend a lot of time blocked in DateTools.stringToDate().

The stringToDate() method uses a singleton SimpleDateFormat object to parse the dates.
Each call to SimpleDateFormat.parse() is *synchronized* because SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe.
