Public Suffix List



Description:
Hi,

I just found this useful list: http://publicsuffix.org/
and thought it would be nice to validate cookie domains against it, basically serving as a black list of domain for which never to set any cookies. What do you think about the attached patch? The download/parsing of the list is of course not part of the implementation.
