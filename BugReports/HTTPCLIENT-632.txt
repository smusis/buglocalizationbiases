Possible NPE in HttpHost



Description:
HttpHost line 167 says:
        if (this.port != this.protocol.getDefaultPort()) {

However, a few lines above, protocol is checked for null.

Line 167 should probably read:

        if (this.protocol != null && this.port != this.protocol.getDefaultPort()) {
