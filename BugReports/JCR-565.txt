Refactor ObservationManagerFactory



Description:
The current o.a.j.core.observation.ObservationManagerFactory class has two main responsibilities:

    1) Create new ObservationManagerImpl instances as an observation manager factory
    2) Manage event consumers and dispatch events within a workspace

These two responsibilities are quite unrelated and the factory responsibility essentially boils down to the following method that is only ever invoked within WorkspaceImpl.getObservationManager():

    public ObservationManagerImpl createObservationManager(SessionImpl session, ItemManager itemMgr) {
        return new ObservationManagerImpl(this, session, itemMgr);
    }

To simplify the design I'd inline this method and rename ObservationManagerFactory to ObservationDispatcher to better reflect the one remaining responsibility.
