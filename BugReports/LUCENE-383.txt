ConstantScoreRangeQuery - fixes "too many clauses" exception



Description:
ConstantScoreQuery wraps a filter (representing a set of documents) and returns
a constant score for each document in the set.

ConstantScoreRangeQuery implements a RangeQuery that works for any number of
terms in the range.  It rewrites to a ConstantScoreQuery that wraps a RangeFilter.

Still needed:
  - unit tests (these classes have been tested and work fine in-house, but the
current tests rely on too much application specific code)
  - code review of Weight() implementation (I'm unsure If I got all the score
normalization stuff right)
  - explain() implementation

NOTE: requires Java 1.4 for BitSet.nextSetBit()
