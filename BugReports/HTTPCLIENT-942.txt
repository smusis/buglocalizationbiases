ClientConnectionRelease example is incorrect



Description:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/httpcomponents/httpclient/tags/4.0.1/httpclient/src/examples/org/apache/http/examples/client/ClientConnectionRelease.java

is incorrect: 

1. if error happens in BufferedReader constructor (OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError), reader.close() is not called and connection is not released

2. if error happens in reader.readLine(), reader.close() is called, but httpget.abort() is not.
