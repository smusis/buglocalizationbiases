HttpMethodBase.getResponseBodyAsString(long limit)



Description:
Currently HttpMethodBase.getResponseBodyAsString() prints warning in log, and suggests using getResponseStream(). However getResponseBodyAsString() is extremely useful (as it is easy to use). So my wish is to have method

getResponseBodyAsString(long limit)

that should throw HttpException if response size exceeds specified limit.

Same things with getResponseBody(long limit) .

Original methods should be deprecated because of danger, explained in javadoc.
