reorder arguments of Field constructor to be more intuitive



Description:
I think Field should take (name, value, type) not (name, type, value) ?

This seems more intuitive and consistent with previous releases

Take this change to some code I had for example:
{noformat}
-    d1.add(new Field("foo", "bar", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.ANALYZED));
+    d1.add(new Field("foo", TextField.TYPE_STORED, "bar"));
{noformat}

I think it would be better if it was
{noformat}
document.add(new Field("foo", "bar", TextField.TYPE_STORED));
{noformat}
