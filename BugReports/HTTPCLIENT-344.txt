HttpConnection.isOpen() logging is not accurate



Description:
isOpen() does not differentiate between stale and closed.  If the connection is closed isStale() will return 
true.  The logs will then indicate that the connection was stale, even though it was really just closed.  
close() is also called a second time unnecessarily.

This should be fixed for 3.0, and perhaps even 2.0.1.
