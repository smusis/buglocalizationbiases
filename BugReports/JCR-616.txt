Completeness/Freshness of NamespaceRegistry and NodeTypeRegistry



Description:
We need to define the requirements on completeness and freshness of RepositoryService.getRegisteredNamespaces().

Right now the optimistic assumption seems to be that an SPI provider is able to report all namespaces that can occur in a repository beforehand. Even if it can do that (and I know of potential targets for SPI that simply can't), this seems to be quite a waste of time if these namespace prefixes aren't actually used later on.

Furthermore, in SPI namespace prefixes aren't really relevant, except to enable the transient layer to return "meaningful" prefixes instead of automatically generated ones.

Therefore my propoal would be to:

1) Clarify that the Map returned from getRegisteredNamespaces() isn't required to be complete,

2) Enhance JCR2SPI to auto-generate prefixes when it encounters namespaces not in the registry.

I expect this to also affect RepositoryService.(un)registerNamespace(...), but let's discuss the underlying issue first...
