Broke lock tests in jcr2spi after the JCR 2.0 upgrade



Description:
My changes during the JCR 2.0 upgrade have broken the following tests in spi2jcr:

    org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.lock.LockTest
    org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.lock.SessionScopedLockTest

I'll mark them as known issues for now to get the Hudson build back up again, but will continue looking at what I did to cause this breakage.
