Unsynchronized NameFactoryImpl initialization



Description:
org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.commons.name.NameFactoryImpl uses an unsafe pattern when initializing:

    private static NameFactory FACTORY;
    private NameFactoryImpl() {};
    public static NameFactory getInstance() {
        if (FACTORY == null) {
            FACTORY = new NameFactoryImpl();
        }
        return FACTORY;
    }

This is bad in a multi-threaded environment (see http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-dcl.html for details).
