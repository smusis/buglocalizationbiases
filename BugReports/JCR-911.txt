Remove sanityCheck() from ItemImpl.getSession()



Description:
The following code causes an InvalidItemStateException to be thrown for no good reason:

    Property property = ...;
    property.setValue((Value) null);
    property.getSession();

There are cases (I'm looking at one right now) where it's good to be able to access the session of an Item even if it has already been invalidated.

The simple fix is to remove the sanityCheck() call from ItemImpl.getSession(). I'll do that unless someone has a good reason why the sanity check should be kept.
