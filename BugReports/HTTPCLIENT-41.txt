New method to add an array of parameters to PostMethod



Description:
When posting a form a web page may have many parameters to post to the 
webserver.  Currently in PostMethod, if you wanted to add multiple parameters, 
you would have to call addParameter(name, value) for each one.

A new convinence method should be added to allow for simpler client code by 
taking an array of NameValuePair objects and adding all parameters in a single 
function call.

void addParameters(NameValuePair[] parameters) 

Also, the comments for PostMethod functions that deal with parameters 
state "Override method of HttpMethodBase ..." which is incorrect.  More 
informative comments should be added to this public API.
