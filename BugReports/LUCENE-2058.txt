benchmark pkg: specify trec_eval submission output from the command line



Description:
the QueryDriver for the trec benchmark currently requires 4 command line arguments.
the third argument is ignored (i typically populate this with "bogus")
Instead, allow the third argument to specify the submission.txt file for trec_eval.

while I am here, add a usage() documenting what the arguments to this driver program do.
