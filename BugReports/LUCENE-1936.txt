Remove deprecated charset support from Greek and Russian analyzers



Description:
This removes the deprecated support for custom charsets.

One thing I found is that once these charsets are removed, RussianLowerCaseFilter is the same as LowerCaseFilter.
So I marked it deprecated to be removed in 3.1
