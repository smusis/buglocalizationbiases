Minor performance improvement to IdleConnectionHandler



Description:
The attached patch does the following changes to IdleConnectionHandler
 - as it iterator over a map of connections, using a LinkedHashMap is a faster
 - rather than using an iterator over the keyset and subsequently getting the values, an iterator over the entry set is used instead for efficiency (at least according to FindBugs)

Note that the patch contains other changes to make variables final where possible. This was done automatically by Eclipse, and can be removed if desired. However I see no harm in them, other than they affect more of the code than intended by the patch.
