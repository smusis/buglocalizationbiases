highlighter problems with overlapping tokens



Description:
The lucene highlighter has problems when tokens that overlap are generated.

For example, if analysis of iPod generates the tokens "i", "pod", "ipod" (with pod and ipod in the same position),
then the highlighter will output this as iipod, regardless of if any of those tokens are highlighted.
