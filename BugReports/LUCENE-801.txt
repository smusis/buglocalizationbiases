build.xml in cnotrib/benchmark should auto build core java and demo if required



Description:
Currently one needs to build core jar and demo jar before building/running benchmark.
This is not very convenient. 
Change it to 
- use core classes and demo classes (instead of jars).
- build core and demo by dependency if required.
