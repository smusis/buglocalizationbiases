DbDataStore connection does not always reconnect



Description:
If a DbDataStore connection is closed due to an error all subsequent addRecord calls will fail with 'connection has been closed and autoReconnect == false'
 after getRecord is called and the connection is reconnected addRecord will succeed.

the connection should be validated before setting autoReconnect = false or on retrieval from the pool.
