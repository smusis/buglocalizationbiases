Deadlock in IndexWriter



Description:
If autoCommit == true a merge usually triggers a commit. A commit (prepareCommit) can trigger a merge vi the flush method. There is a synchronization mechanism for commit (commitLock) and a separate synchronization mechanism for merging (ConcurrentMergeScheduler.wait). If one thread holds the commitLock monitor and another one holds the ConcurrentMergeScheduler monitor we have a deadlock.
