integrate snowball stopword lists



Description:
The snowball project creates stopword lists as well as stemmers, example: http://svn.tartarus.org/snowball/trunk/website/algorithms/english/stop.txt?view=markup

This patch includes the following:
* snowball stopword lists for 13 languages in contrib/snowball/resources
* all stoplists are unmodified, only added license header and converted each one from whatever encoding it was in to UTF-8
* added getSnowballWordSet  to WordListLoader, this is because the format of these files is very different, for example it supports multiple words per line and embedded comments.

I did not add any changes to SnowballAnalyzer to actually automatically use these lists yet, i would like us to discuss this in a future issue proposing integrating snowball with contrib/analyzers.
