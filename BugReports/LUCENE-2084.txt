remove Byte/CharBuffer wrapping for collation key generation



Description:
We can remove the overhead of ByteBuffer and CharBuffer wrapping in CollationKeyFilter and ICUCollationKeyFilter.

this patch moves the logic in IndexableBinaryStringTools into char[],int,int and byte[],int,int based methods, with the previous Byte/CharBuffer methods delegating to these.
Previously, the Byte/CharBuffer methods required a backing array anyway.
