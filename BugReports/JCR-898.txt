Improve excerpt fragments



Description:
Improve the excerpt fragments:

- If a fragment starts at the very beginning of a text, the first Word is cut off
- If a fragment does not start with the beginning of a sentence a '...' should be prepended
- If matching terms in a fragment are within range of 75 characters the fragment is extended too far and may produce a larger fragment than requested
