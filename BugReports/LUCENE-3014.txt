comparator API for segment versions



Description:
See LUCENE-3012 for an example.

Things get ugly if you want to use SegmentInfo.getVersion()

For example, what if we committed my patch, release 3.2, but later released 3.1.1 (will "3.1.1" this be whats written and returned by this function?)
Then suddenly we broke the index format because we are using Strings here without a reasonable comparator API.

In this case one should be able to compute if the version is < 3.2 safely.

If we don't do this, and we rely upon this version information internally in lucene, I think we are going to break something.
