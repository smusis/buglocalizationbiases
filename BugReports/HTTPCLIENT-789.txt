Support for passing an SSLContext to the SSLSocketFactory of HttpClient



Description:
Would it be possible to use an existing instance of SSLContext to initialise an SSLSocketFactory? This would allow using SSLContexts configured with more options, such as CRLs.

(This follows the thread of the httpclient-commons-dev list: http://marc.info/?l=httpclient-commons-dev&m=121737017814116&w=2 ).
