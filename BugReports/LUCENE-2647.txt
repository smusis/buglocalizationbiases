Move & rename the terms dict, index, abstract postings out of oal.index.codecs.standard



Description:
The terms dict components that current live under Standard codec
(oal.index.codecs.standard.*) are in fact very generic, and in no way
particular to the Standard codec.  Already we have many other codecs
(sep, fixed int block, var int block, pulsing, appending) that re-use
the terms dict writer/reader components.

So I'd like to move these out into oal.index.codecs, and rename them:

  * StandardTermsDictWriter/Reader -> PrefixCodedTermsWriter/Reader
  * StandardTermsIndexWriter/Reader -> AbstractTermsIndexWriter/Reader
  * SimpleStandardTermsIndexWriter/Reader -> SimpleTermsIndexWriter/Reader
  * StandardPostingsWriter/Reader -> AbstractPostingsWriter/Reader
  * StandardPostingsWriterImpl/ReaderImple -> StandardPostingsWriter/Reader

With this move we have a nice reusable terms dict impl.  The terms
index impl is still well-decoupled so eg we could [in theory] explore
a variable gap terms index.

Many codecs, I expect, don't need/want to implement their own terms
dict....

There are no code/index format changes here, besides the renaming &
fixing all imports/usages of the renamed class.
