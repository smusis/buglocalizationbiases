Add FixedBitSet.and(other/DISI), andNot(other/DISI)



Description:
For the parent issue, and() and andNot() on DISIs and other FixedBitSets are missing. This issue will add those methods.

The DISI methods (also the already existing or(DISI)) method will check for OpenBitSetIterator and do an inplace operation using the bits as optimization.
