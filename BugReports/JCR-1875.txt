Failing Node.unlock() might leave inconsistent transient state



Description:
Similar to issue JCR-538 but for Node.unlock():

If updating the lock related properties (jcr:lockIsDeep or jcr:lockOwner) fails e.g. due to missing permission, there might be inconsistent transient modifications pending.
