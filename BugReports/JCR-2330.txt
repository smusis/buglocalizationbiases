Restore mix:referenceable check to SessionImpl.getNodeByUUID



Description:
In revision 504623 we commented out the mix:referenceable check in the SessionImpl.getNodeByUUID() method:

    // since the uuid of a node is only exposed through jcr:uuid declared
    // by mix:referenceable it's rather unlikely that a client can possibly
    // know the internal uuid of a non-referenceable node; omitting the
    // check for mix:referenceable seems therefore to be a reasonable
    // compromise in order to improve performance.
    /*
    if (node.isNodeType(Name.MIX_REFERENCEABLE)) {
        return node;
    } else {
        // there is a node with that uuid but the node does not expose it
        throw new ItemNotFoundException(uuid.toString());
    }
    */

This solved a minor performance issue issue with client code that used the node UUID as a quick way to access a node. The downside was a slight incompatibility with the spec that says that the getNodeByUUID method is only supposed to work with mix:referenceable nodes.

Now with JCR 2.0 clients can (and should) use the Session.getNodeByIdentifier method that does not have the mix:referenceable limitation. Thus we can restore the original and correct functionality of the getNodeByUUID method.
