Several bugs in last SVN commit



Description:
Just a few bugs in the last SVN commit, but since I work with it, i thought useful to mention them :
1) org.apache.jackrabbit.ocm.reflection.ReflectionUtils should handle Set --> just add it in defaultImplementation
2) in org.apache.jackrabbit.ocm.manager.collectionconverter.ManageableObjectsUtil.getManageableObjects, correct defaultImplementation test :
        		if (defaultImplementation == null)
        		{
        			throw new JcrMappingException("No default implementation for the interface " + manageableObjectsClass);

Thank you and keep up the good work!

Sincerely yours,

Stephane
