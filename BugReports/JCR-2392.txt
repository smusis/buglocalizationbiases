[patch] QValueFactoryImpl.equals doesn't do compare correctly



Description:
equals compares it's uri to it's own uri, as poosed to the other one.

                 // for both the value has not been loaded yet
                 if (!initialized) {
                     if (other.uri != null) {
-                        return uri.equals(uri);
+                        return other.uri.equals(uri);
                     } else {
                         // need to load the binary value in order to be able
                         // to compare the 2 values.
