Consolidate Near Real Time and Reopen API semantics



Description:
We should consolidate the IndexWriter.getReader and the IndexReader.reopen semantics, since most people are already using the IR.reopen() method, we should simply add::
{code}
IR.reopen(IndexWriter)
{code}

Initially, it could just call the IW.getReader(), but it probably should switch to just using package private methods for sharing the internals
