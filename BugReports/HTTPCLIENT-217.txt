httpMethod.abort needed



Description:
This is the problem : I use the httpclient to fire many requests. At some point 
of time, the server has queued up requests. So certain requests are waiting for 
response. Now when I call httpMethod.releaseConnection, the request should stop 
waiting for the response and the connection should be closed. However, this 
does not happen. The request is only given up after it has timed out.
