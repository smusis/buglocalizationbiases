SQL2 parser may infer type for UncastLiteral from static analysis



Description:
The spec says:

"An UncastLiteral is always interpreted as a Value of property type STRING. A CastLiteral, on the other hand, is interpreted as the string form of a Value of the PropertyType indicated."

There are also two test cases in NodeNameTest that need to be fixed accordingly: testLongLiteral and testBooleanLiteral
