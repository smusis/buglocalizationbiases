ShingleMatrixFilter eaily throws StackOverFlow as the complexity of a matrix grows



Description:
ShingleMatrixFilter#next makes a recursive function invocation when the current permutation iterator is exhausted or if the current state of the permutation iterator already has produced an identical shingle. In a not too complex matrix this will require a gigabyte sized stack per thread.

My solution is to avoid the recursive invocation by refactoring like this:

{code:java}
public Token next(final Token reusableToken) throws IOException {
    assert reusableToken != null;
    if (matrix == null) {
      matrix = new Matrix();
      // fill matrix with maximumShingleSize columns
      while (matrix.columns.size() < maximumShingleSize && readColumn()) {
        // this loop looks ugly
      }
    }

    // this loop exists in order to avoid recursive calls to the next method
    // as the complexity of a large matrix
    // then would require a multi gigabyte sized stack.
    Token token;
    do {
      token = produceNextToken(reusableToken);
    } while (token == request_next_token);
    return token;
  }

  
  private static final Token request_next_token = new Token();

  /**
   * This method exists in order to avoid reursive calls to the method
   * as the complexity of a fairlt small matrix then easily would require
   * a gigabyte sized stack per thread.
   *
   * @param reusableToken
   * @return null if exhausted, instance request_next_token if one more call is required for an answer, or instance parameter resuableToken.
   * @throws IOException
   */
  private Token produceNextToken(final Token reusableToken) throws IOException {

{code}
