LockTest.testLogout fails to refresh session before checking lock from other session



Description:
LockTest.testLogout() fails to refresh the session before checking the lock state of a node that was locked by another session.

Proposal:

Insert 

  n1.refresh(false);

before 

  assertTrue("node must be locked", n1.isLocked());
