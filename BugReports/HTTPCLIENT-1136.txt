BasicClientConnectionManager.releaseConnection accesses poolEntry using non-standard lock



Description:
According to the annotation, poolEntry is @GuardedBy("this").

However, in at least one place, it is accessed without holding a lock on this: 

BasicClientConnectionManager.releaseConnection synchronizes on managedConn, and then accesses poolEntry without synchronising on this.

[Synch. only works if all parties use the same lock.]
