JCR2SPI: potential race condition in event listener registration



Description:
There's a potential race condition when the first event listener is registered (ObservationManager.addEventListener). The observation manager should only start listening for events after the new SPI event filter has been created.

(Note there's a related problem when an *additional* event listener is getting registered, while a RepositoryService.getEvents call is already in progress).
