Jcr-Server: useful output upon GET to root- and workspace-resources



Description:
in contrast to the resources representing JCR Node or Properties, the 'root' resource and the resources representing the
workspaces present in the repository don't provide any output when accessed in a browser.

-> add some very simple listing for those 2 resource types.
