extensibility changes to SimpleWebdavServlet



Description:
the new SimpleWebdavServlet class lost some of the extensibility of the old WebdavServlet that allowed subclasses to ignore the dependency on RepositoryAccessServlet and provide their own support objects. attached is a patch that adds back these qualities.
