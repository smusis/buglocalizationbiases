Contrib/Module-uptodate assume name matches path and jar



Description:
With adding a new 'queries' module, I am trying to change the project name of contrib/queries to queries-contrib.  However currently the contrib-uptodate assumes that the name property is used in the path and in the jar name.

By using the name in the path, I must set the value to 'queries' (since the path is contrib/queries).  However because the project name is now queries-contrib, the actual jar file will be lucene-queries-contrib-${version}.jar, not lucene-queries-${version}.jar, as is expected.

Consequently I think we need to separate the path name from the jar name properties.  For simplicity I think adding a new jar-name property will suffice, which can be optional and if omitted, is filled in with the name property.
