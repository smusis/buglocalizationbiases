Query does not work after logging into workspace with no indexes



Description:
When I login to workspace that does not have indexes, they are created but my queries do not return results unless I relog. Output from running attached code sample is:

Node [node1240842434531] created in workspace [test1240842434312]
Property [name] set to [someValueOfMyProperty]
Asking query: select * from nt:unstructured where nt:name like 'someValueOfMyProperty'
Found: 1 nodes before deleting index.
Asking query: select * from nt:unstructured where nt:name like 'someValueOfMyProperty'
Found: 0 nodes after deleting index.
done
