Remove or deprecate contrib/similarity



Description:
Classes under contrib/similarity seem to be duplicates of classes under contrib/queries.
I'd like to remove *.java from contrib/similarity without bothering with deprecation, since the same functionality exists in contrib/queries.
Anyone minds?
