Weird BooleanQuery behavior



Description:
Here's a simple OR-connected query.

T:files T:deleting C:thanks C:exists

The query above hits 1 document. But following *same* query only
with parenthesis results nothing.

(T:files T:deleting) (C:thanks C:exists)

Another combinations of MUST and SHOULD.

"T:files T:deleting +C:production +C:optimize" hits 1 document.
"(T:files T:deleting) (+C:production +C:optimize)" hits 1 document.
