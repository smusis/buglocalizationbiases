Authentication Mechanism Based on Login Token



Description:
implementing an authentication mechanism that apart from simple credentials allows for credentials being built on a login token
could rely on the fact that jackrabbit stores the user data in the repository: adding additional information (generated tokens, expiration time, 
additional security parameters) could be stored in additional subnodes to the user and used for matching during login as alternative
ways to authenticate against the system.
