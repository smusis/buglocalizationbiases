Manage Lucene FieldCaches per index segment



Description:
Jackrabbit uses an IndexSearcher which searches on a single IndexReader which is most likely to be an instance of CachingMultiReader. On every search that does sorting or range queries a FieldCache is populated and associated with this instance of a CachingMultiReader. On successive queries which operate on this CachingMultiReader you will get a tremendous speedup for queries which can reuse  those associated FieldCache instances.
The problem is that Jackrabbit creates a new CachingMultiReader _everytime_ one of the underlying indexes are modified. This means if you just change _one_ item in the repository you will need to rebuild all those FieldCaches because the existing FieldCaches are associated with the old instance of CachingMultiReader.
This does not only lead to slow search response times for queries which contains range queries or are sorted by a field but also leads to massive memory consumption (depending on the size of your indexes) because there might be multiple instances of CachingMultiReaders in use if you have a scenario where a lot of queries and item modifications are executed concurrently.
The goal is to keep those FieldCaches as long as possible.
