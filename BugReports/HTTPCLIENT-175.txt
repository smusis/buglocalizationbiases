HttpState cannot differentiate credentials for different hosts with same Realm names



Description:
It seems that one needs a separate HttpState per client per host: from the 
javadocs, if (by coincidence or by design) more than one host uses the same 
realm name, such as "Private", then there's an unresolvable conflict, as 
HttpState can only store one set of credentials for a given name...

According to Oleg Kalnichevski, it is plausible just to extend the HttpState 
class with additional methods that would require host to be specified along the
authentication realm when dealing with credentials.
