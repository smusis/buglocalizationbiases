throw exception for fieldcache on a non-atomic reader



Description:
In Lucene 4.0, we go through a lot of effort to prevent slow uses of non-atomic readers:

DirectoryReader/MultiReader etc throw exception if you don't try to access postings or docvalues apis per-segment, etc.

But the biggest trap of all is still too easy to fall into, we don't do the same for FieldCache.

I think we should throw exception, forcing the user to either change their code or use a SlowMultiReaderWrapper.
