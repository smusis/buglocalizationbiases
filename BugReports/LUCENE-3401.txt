need to ensure that sims that use collection-level stats (e.g. sumTotalTermFreq) handle non-existent field



Description:
Because of things like queryNorm, unfortunately similarities have to handle the case where they are asked to computeStats() for a term, where the field does not exist at all.
(Note they will never have to actually score anything, but unless we break how queryNorm works for TFIDF, we have to deal with this case).

I noticed this while doing some benchmarking, so i created a test to test some cases like this across all the sims.
