Javadoc: does not mention Expires; clarify validate



Description:
The Expires attribute processing is not mentioned in any of the Javadoc, as far
as I can tell. 

Also, the public method parseAttribute() actually handles the attributes, but
does not contain the details. It would be useful if there was at least a
backlink to the parse() documentation.

It's not clear from the Javadoc whether parse() automatically calls validate()
or not. It doesn't.
