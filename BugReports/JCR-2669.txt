Improve reading of cached UUID for given document number



Description:
CachingIndexReader.document(int n, FieldSelector fieldSelector) creates a new
Field from the cached UUID. The lucene Field implementation always does a
String.intern() on the field name, which is quite slow. We should probably have
our own implementation for that specific use case where we know that the name
is already interned. e.g. UUIDField implements Fieldable.
