Netscape proxy problem wtih POST



Description:
Description:

When using httpClient to POST to a http url through a Netscape proxy server, 
the httpClient failed due to read error when reading status line.  The log seem 
to indicate that the proxy is talking HTTP/1.0 and does not expect the POST 
data to come.  I am using a modified version of the ClientApp from examples.  I 
will attach both the test program and log files.

Workaround:

If use PostMethod.setUseExpect (true), it will work.  But in many cases, it 
would be slower.

Related issues:

In doing the test, I also found out that the httpClient PostMehtod does not 
work when the request body is NOT set (not calling setRequestBody).  It also 
does not work with empty body (setRequestBody ("")).  The attached 
clientApp.properties file has flags to test each case and I will attach the 
logs as well.  Excuse my ignorance, I do not know for sure what the HTTP spec. 
says about the body in the POST method.  But at least if the caller/app is 
wrong in not setting the body, some exception should be thrown.  It could also 
be my server's problem, please let me know if that is the case (I am using 
weblogic server 6.1).
