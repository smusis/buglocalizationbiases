client cache does not respect 'Cache-Control: no-store' on requests



Description:
"The purpose of the no-store directive is to prevent the inadvertent release or retention of sensitive information (for example, on backup tapes). The no-store directive applies to the entire message, and MAY be sent either in a response or in a request. If sent in a request, a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this request or any response to it."

The current implementation will incorrectly cache responses to requests containing 'Cache-Control: no-store'.
