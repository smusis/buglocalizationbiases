org.apache.jackrabbit.server.remoting.davex.JsonWriter: wrong value type for ::NodeIteratorSize attribute



Description:
the ::NodeIteratorSize attribute is serialized as string value whereas the client expects a long value.
this causes unnecessery server-roundtrips since the client doesn't detect this hint.
