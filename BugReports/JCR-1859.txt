BeanLazyLoader is not Serializable



Description:
Class org.apache.jackrabbit.ocm.manager.objectconverter.impl.BeanLazyLoader is not serializable.
In ocm module we can mark some property to be lazy loaded. For example @Bean(..., proxy=true)
In such scenario instead of object we will have here proxy BeanLazyLoader which is not serializable.

It is problematic while using another technologies. 
For example Spring WebFlow requires objects (model) stored in scope to be Serializable.
So when we use proxied model with Spring WebFlow we received exception "org.springframework.webflow.execution.repository.snapshot.SnapshotCreationException: Could not serialize flow execution; make sure all objects stored in flow or flash scope are serializable.... Caused by: java.io.NotSerializableException: org.apache.jackrabbit.ocm.manager.objectconverter.impl.BeanLazyLoader
..."

Please make BeanLazyLoader Serializable.
