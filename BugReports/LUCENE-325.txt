[PATCH] new method expungeDeleted() added to IndexWriter



Description:
We make use the docIDs in lucene. I need a way to compact the docIDs in segments
to remove the "holes" created from doing deletes. The only way to do this is by
calling IndexWriter.optimize(). This is a very heavy call, for the cases where
the index is large but with very small number of deleted docs, calling optimize
is not practical.

I need a new method: expungeDeleted(), which finds all the segments that have
delete documents and merge only those segments.

I have implemented this method and have discussed with Otis about submitting a
patch. I don't see where I can attached the patch. I will do according to the
patch guidleine and email the lucene mailing list.

Thanks
