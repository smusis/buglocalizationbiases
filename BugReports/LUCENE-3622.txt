separate IndexDocValues interface from implementation



Description:
Currently the o.a.l.index.values contains both the abstract apis and Lucene40's current implementation.

I think we should move the implementation underneath Lucene40Codec, leaving only the abstract apis.

For example, simpletext might have a different implementation, and we might make a int8 implementation
underneath preflexcodec to support norms.
