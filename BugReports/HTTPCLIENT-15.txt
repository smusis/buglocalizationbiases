redirect not handled correctly if location header doesn't have a protocol



Description:
Http redirect is not handled correctly if the location header doesn't have a 
protocol, e.g.:

Location: web/tbghome.nsf/pages/index

a java.net.MalformedURLException is throw in this case. The correct behavior is 
to inherit the protocol from current URL.

The relevant code is in HttpMethodBase.execute()
