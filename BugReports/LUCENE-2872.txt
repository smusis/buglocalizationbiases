Terms dict should block-encode terms



Description:
With PrefixCodedTermsReader/Writer we now encode each term standalone,
ie its bytes, metadata, details for postings (frq/prox file pointers),
etc.

But, this is costly when something wants to visit many terms but pull
metadata for only few (eg respelling, certain MTQs).  This is
particularly costly for sep codec because it has more metadata to
store, per term.

So instead I think we should block-encode all terms between indexed
term, so that the metadata is stored "column stride" instead.  This
makes it faster to enum just terms.
