DocValues cleanup: constructor & getInnerArray()



Description:
DocValues constructor taking a numDocs parameter is not very clean.
Get rid of this.

Also, it's optional getInnerArray() method is not very clean.
This is necessary for better testing, but currently tests will fail if it is not implemented.
Modify it to throw UnSupportedOp exception (rather than returning an empty array).
Modify tests to not fail but just warn if the tested iml does not override it.

These changes should make it easier to implement DocValues for other ValueSource's, e.g. above payloads, with or without caching.
