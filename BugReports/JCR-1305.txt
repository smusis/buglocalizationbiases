JNDI data sources with BundleDbPersistenceManager: UnsupportedOperationException



Description:
When using the org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.BasicDataSourceFactory, the BundleDbPersistenceManager can not open a database connection via JNDI because the method DataSource.getConnection(user, password) is not supported. Instead, DataSource.getConnection() must be used for this to work.

ConnectionFactory.getConnection should be changed to call this method if user name and password are empty.
