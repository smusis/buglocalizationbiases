Query for all node fails after restart



Description:
The query handler initially indexes the node type definitions exposed at /jcr:system/jcr:nodetypes. However after a restart or a node type registration the UUIDs of those nodes will change because they consist of VirtualNodeStates. The index will still use the UUIDs of the initial indexing and will return a query result that refers to UUIDs that do not exist in the workspace anymore.

As an short term solution we should disable indexing of VirtualNodeStates.

Please note, this does not only apply to xpath queries but also sql queries of course.
