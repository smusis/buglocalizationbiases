Version.isSame(Object) not working



Description:
Version interface is implemented (on the frontend) by the VersionImpl class (extending NodeWrapper), which delegates to an internal NodeImpl class, which in turn extends ItemImpl.

Say you have :
      Node node = // at Version 1.0
      Version version = // retrieved as 1.0 for the node
      Version baseVersion = node.getBaseVersion()

You now expect
      baseVersion.isSame(version)
even if
      baseVersion != version

This fails, because VersionImpl delegates the isSame call to its delegatee, thus above call becomes
      ((VersionImpl) baseVersion).delegatee.isSame(version)
where this method is implemented by the ItemImpl class from which the delegatee NodeImpl extends.

That latter implementation ItemImpl.isSame() only returns true if the other is an ItemImpl, too. But this is not the case because VersionImpl is a Version, NodeWrapper, Node but not an ItemImpl.

Probably the best solution would be for NodeImpl.isSame() to check whether the otherItem is a NodeWrapper und use ((NodeWrapper) otherItem).delegatee as the otherItem for the delegatee call.

On another track: ItemImpl.isSame() should probably do a fast check whether the otherItem is actually the same instance to prevent type checks...
