Incorporate GeoHash in contrib/spatial



Description:
Based on comments from Yonik and Ryan in SOLR-773 
GeoHash provides the ability to store latitude / longitude values in a single field consistent hash field.
Which elements the need to maintain 2 field caches for latitude / longitude fields, reducing the size of an index
and the amount of memory needed for a spatial search.
