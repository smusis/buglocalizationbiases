potential memory leak when using ThreadSafeClientConnManager



Description:
When using ThreadSafeClientConnManager and developing with Jetty using auto-redeploy feature eventually I run into a PermGen out of memory exception.  I investigated with YourKit 8.0.6 and found a class loader circular reference in RefQueueWorker.  Not really sure what I was doing I made the refQueueHandler non-final and nulled it in the shutdown method of RedQueueWorker.  I don't seem to have the problem any longer with circular class loader references.
