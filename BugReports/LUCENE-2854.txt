Deprecate SimilarityDelegator and Similarity.lengthNorm



Description:
SimilarityDelegator is a back compat trap (see LUCENE-2828).

Apps should just [statically] subclass Sim or DefaultSim; if they really need "runtime subclassing" then they can make their own app-level delegator.

Also, Sim.computeNorm subsumes lengthNorm, so we should deprecate lengthNorm in favor of computeNorm.
