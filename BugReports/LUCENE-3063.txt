factor CharTokenizer/CharacterUtils into analyzers module



Description:
Currently these analysis components are in the lucene core, but should really
be .util in the analyzers module.

Also, with MockTokenizer extending Tokenizer directly, we can add some additional
checks in the future to try to ensure our consumers are being good consumers (e.g. calling reset).

This is mentioned in http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/TestIdeas, I didn't implement it here yet,
this is just the factoring. I think we should try to do this before LUCENE-3040.
