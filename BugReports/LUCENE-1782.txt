Rename OriginalQueryParserHelper



Description:
We should rename the new QueryParser so it's clearer that it's
Lucene's default QueryParser, going forward, and not just a temporary
"bridge" to a future new QueryParser.

How about we rename oal.queryParser.original -->
oal.queryParser.standard (can't use "default": it's a Java keyword)?
Then, leave the OriginalQueryParserHelper under that package, but
simply rename it to QueryParser?

This way if we create other sub-packages in the future, eg
ComplexPhraseQueryParser, they too can have a QueryParser class under
them, to make it clear that's the "top" class you use to parse
queries.
