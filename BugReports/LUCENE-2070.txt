document LengthFilter wrt Unicode 4.0



Description:
LengthFilter calculates its min/max length from TermAttribute.termLength()
This is not characters, but instead UTF-16 code units.

In my opinion this should not be changed, merely documented.
If we changed it, it would have an adverse performance impact because we would have to actually calculate Character.codePointCount() on the text.

If you feel strongly otherwise, fixing it to count codepoints would be a trivial patch, but I'd rather not hurt performance.
I admit I don't fully understand all the use cases for this filter.
