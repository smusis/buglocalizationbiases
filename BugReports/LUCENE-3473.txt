CheckIndex should verify numUniqueTerms == recomputedNumUniqueTerms



Description:
Just glancing at the code it seems to sorta do this check, but only in the hasOrd==true case maybe (which seems to be testing something else)?

It would be nice to verify this also for terms dicts that dont support ord.

we should add explicit checks per-field in 4.x, and for-all-fields in 3.x and preflex
