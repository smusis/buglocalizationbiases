move JDK collation to core, ICU collation to ICU contrib



Description:
As mentioned on the list, I propose we move the JDK-based CollationKeyFilter/CollationKeyAnalyzer, currently located in contrib/collation into core for collation support (language-sensitive sorting)

These are not much code (the heavy duty stuff is already in core, IndexableBinaryString). 

And I would also like to move the ICUCollationKeyFilter/ICUCollationKeyAnalyzer (along with the jar file they depend on) also currently located in contrib/collation into a contrib/icu.

This way, we can start looking at integrating other functionality from ICU into a fully-fleshed out icu contrib.
