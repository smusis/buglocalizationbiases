Consistency check/fix doesn't work with PSQL persistence manager



Description:
PSQL doesn't save blobs directly into table row, instead saves a link there and puts the binary stream somewhere else. The general consistency check method in BundleDBPersistenceManager doesn't take this into account.
I've fixed this by changing getBytes(Blob) method in BundleDbPersistenceManager to getBytes(ResultSet) and overriding it for PSQL.
