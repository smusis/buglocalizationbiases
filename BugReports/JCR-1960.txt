Add support for the Ingres RDBMS



Description:
Hi Folks,
    I've put together all the stuff I can figure out that is required to add support for using the Ingres RBMS. I'll upload a svn diff for what I've done. It is against the 1.5.2 version from the tags repository.

    I was looking around but couldn't see if there was a way of running a test suite using Ingres as the DBMS provider. Is that possible with the current environment?

Cheers
