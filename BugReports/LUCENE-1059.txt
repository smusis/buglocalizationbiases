bad java practices which affect performance (result of code inspection)



Description:
IntelliJ IDEA found the following issues in the Lucense source code and tests:

1) explicit for loops where calls to System.arraycopy() should have been
2) calls to Boolean constructor (in stead of the appropriate static method/field)
3) instantiation of unnecessary Integer instances for toString, instead of calling the static one
4) String concatenation using + inside a call to StringBuffer.append(), in stead of chaining the append calls

all minor issues. patch is forthcoming.
