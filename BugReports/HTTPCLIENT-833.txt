SSLSocketFactory.connectSocket() possible NPE - or use of wrong variable?



Description:
SSLSocketFactory.connectSocket() has a possible NPE at line 324:

            sock.connect(remoteAddress, connTimeout);

Or perhaps this should really be:

            sslsock.connect(remoteAddress, connTimeout);
