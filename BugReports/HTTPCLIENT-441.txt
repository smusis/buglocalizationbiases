Cookie.java hashCode method violates contract



Description:
org.apache.commons.httpclient.Cookie hashCode() does not meet object.hashCode
() contract.  Cookie.hashCode() returns different values even though data used 
in equals() comparison is the same.

Contract:**Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an 
execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return 
the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the 
object is modified.**

Breaks use of cookie within collections such as when using contains().

Traced problem back to parent class NameValuePair.  Cookie.hashCode() calls 
NameValuePair.hashCode() which relies on name/value hashes.  Cookie does not 
rely on value to determine equality.
