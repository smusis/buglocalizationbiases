Transfer-Encoding: identity not supported + possible patch



Description:
In HttpMethodBase.readResponseBody only chunked transfer encoding is 
supported.  Some proxy servers like Privoxy, etc send a Transfer-Encoding: 
identity header and HttpClient fails quietly and returns a null result input 
stream.  At line 2037 in HttpMethodBase.java revision 1.160 I inserted the 
following two lines and it appeared to work fine:

} else if ("identity".equalsIgnoreCase(transferEncodingHeader.getValue())) {
   result = is;

I think it should at least throw an exception or do something when it 
encounters an unsupported Transfer-Encoding instead of returning a null input 
stream.
