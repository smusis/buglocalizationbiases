Fix JFlex tokenizer compiler warnings



Description:
We get lots of distracting fallthrough warnings running "ant compile"
in modules/analysis, from the tokenizers generated from JFlex.

Digging a bit, they actually do look spooky.

So I managed to edit the JFlex inputs to insert a bunch of break
statements in our rules, but I have no idea if this is
right/dangerous, and it seems a bit weird having to do such insertions
of "naked" breaks.

But, this does fix all the warnings, and all tests pass...
