NullPointerException in constructor of JcrDavException



Description:
within DavSessionProviderImpl.attachSession() a org.apache.jackrabbit.rmi.client.RemoteRepositoryException is thrown, catched as RepositoryException and passed into the 
ctor of JcrDavException

the lookup for the class in the static HashMap codeMap for the class fails and a NPE is thrown 

suggested fix:
The static lookup by the javax.jcr.*Exception classed must be fixed to include derived exception classes.
