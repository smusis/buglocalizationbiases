jcr:like() does not scale well on large value ranges



Description:
There are two major issues with the current WildcardQuery implementation:

1) A wildcard expression is restricted to match at most 1024 terms, otherwise a TooManyClauses exception is thrown. Similar to the RangeQuery issue: JCR-111
2) The enumeration over the terms that match the wildcard pattern is slow
