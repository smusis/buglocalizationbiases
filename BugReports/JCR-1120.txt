RemoveVersionTest.testReferentialIntegrityException assumes availability of ref properties and same name sibilings



Description:
This test case:

- assumes availability of Reference properties (should throw NotExecutable when not available), and

- takes advantage if same name siblings (the child node identified by the nodename2 config variable has already been created by the test setup code)
