Upgrade to SLF4J 1.3



Description:
Version 1.1 of the SLF4J logging facade was recently released. It contains no functional improvements that we'd need, but is split to a separate slf4j-api library and a set of backend-specic logging adapters. This would allow us to avoid exposing log4j as a transitive dependency for projects that depend on Jackrabbit.
