Log / trace wrapper for the JCR API



Description:
I have implemented the log / trace mechanism for the JCR API. A short summary:

- A wrapper for a Repository. All other objects that where created directly or indirectly (Session, Node and so on) are wrapped as well. 
- The wrappers log all JCR method calls to a file and call the underlying methods. 
- Return values and calling method / line number can be logged as well (optional). 
- The log file itself is mainly Java source code and can be compiled and run.
- Included is a player to re-play log files (for example, if the log file is too big to be compiled).
