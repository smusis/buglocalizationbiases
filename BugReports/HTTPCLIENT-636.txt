Revise internal data structures of ThreadSafeClientConnManager



Description:
ThreadSafeClientConnManager internal data structures can be improved:
- keep track of issued connections with weak references
- use class derived from WeakReference instead of a lookup table for callbacks from ReferenceThread
  (or drop ReferenceThread in favor of occasionally polling the issued connections for leaks)
