JSP page compilation errors when depoyed using oc4j



Description:
An error in the Welcome.jsp was produced as follows:

cannot find symbol symbol : method log(java.lang.String,java.lang.Throwable)

In a response from the user group it was determined that there should be no expectation in Jackrabbit that the JspPage implementation will inherit from the GeneralServlet base class.
