SimpleHttpConnectionManager is used incorrectly by tutorial code



Description:
Using pretty well standard (from the tutorial) code causes the 
SimpleHttpConnectionManager to print its "being used incorrectly" warning if 
the connection times out (or other I/O exception occurs).

I will attach a simple test I made to demonstrate this.
