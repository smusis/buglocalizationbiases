Omit positions but keep termFreq



Description:
it would be useful to have an option to discard positional information but still keep the term frequency - currently setOmitTermFreqAndPositions discards both. Even though position-dependent queries wouldn't work in such case, still any other queries would work fine and we would get the right scoring.
