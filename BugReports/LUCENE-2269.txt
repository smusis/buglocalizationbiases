don't download/extract 20,000 files when doing the build



Description:
When you build lucene, it downloads and extracts some data for contrib/benchmark, especially the 20,000+ files for the reuters corpus.
this is only needed for one test, and these 20,000 files drive IDEs and such crazy.
instead of doing this by default, we should only download/extract data if you specifically ask (like wikipedia, collation do, etc)

for the qualityrun test, instead use a linedoc formatted 587-line text file, similar to reuters.first20.lines.txt already used by benchmark.
