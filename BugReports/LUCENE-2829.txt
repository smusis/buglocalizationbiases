improve termquery "pk lookup" performance



Description:
For things that are like primary keys and don't exist in some segments (worst case is primary/unique key that only exists in 1)
we do wasted seeks.

While LUCENE-2694 tries to solve some of this issue with TermState, I'm concerned we could every backport that to 3.1 for example.

This is a simpler solution here just to solve this one problem in termquery... we could just revert it in trunk when we resolve LUCENE-2694,
but I don't think we should leave things as they are in 3.x
