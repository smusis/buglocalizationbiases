No good reason: it's historical. 
 
To avoid this either: (a) the BufferedIndexInput API would need to be  
modified to permit subclasses to supply the buffer; or (b)  
RAMInputStream could subclass IndexInput directly, using its own  
buffers.  The latter would probably be simpler. 
 
End of quote. 
 
I made version (b) of RAMInputStream. 
Using this RAMInputStream, TestTermVectorsReader failed as the only 
failing test.
