Exclude tests instead skipping them



Description:
jcr2spi tests run with the spi2jcr module by default so they are configured to be skipped when jcr2spi is built. Manually running a jcr2spi test like this

mvn -Dtest=MyTest -Dmaven.test.skip=false test

does not work however. The pom configuration seems to take precedence here. 

To fix this I propose to exclude all test instead of skipping them making it possible to manually execute tests like this

mvn -Dtest=MyTest test
