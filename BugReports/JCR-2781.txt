FileDataStore performance improvements



Description:
As seen in JCR-2695, the FileDataStore is slow on some file system. 

Some file operations such as File.exists() or File.isDirectory() can be replaced with try / catch, or by inspecting the return value of a previous method (File.renameTo).
