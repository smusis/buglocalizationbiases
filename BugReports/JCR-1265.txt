Lower-Case Search-Function works with Upper-Case Searchstring



Description:
if you perform a query like this
testroot/*[jcr:like(fn:lower-case(@prop1), 'FO%')]
you get valid results even though the value in the property has the "foo" value
The search works with lower and upper-case search strings.
