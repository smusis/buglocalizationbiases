Make behaviour configurable when re-indexing detects workspace inconsistency



Description:
Currently the query handler throws an exception and the repository will not start.

There are multiple options how to deal with this situation:

1) fail and repository startup will fail
2) ignore and proceed
3) fix the inconsistency and proceed

1) and 2) can be implemented quite easily. with the recent enhancement JCR-1428, 3) can also be implemented with reasonable effort.

In any case an error message should be written to the log.
