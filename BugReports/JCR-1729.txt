Node#addNode fails with AccessDeniedException if session lacks read-permission to an ancestor



Description:
Consider a Session that has following permissions:
/home  -> no permission
/home/myself -> read|remove|set_property|add_node

if this session tries to add a Node to /home/myself.
An AccessDeniedException is thrown indicateing that it can not read /home.

The Exception is caused by the Node's check, if it is checked-out.
This check asumes that the session has read-access to all its ancestors.
Which breaks in this case:

see NodeImpl internalIsCheckedOut()   (ln 3875)
