Proxy authentication does not handle multiple multiple authentication schemes



Description:
My proxy server returns the following header lines in the response:

    Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM
    Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm="10.105.20.201"

i.e., it returns two Proxy-Authenticate header lines. Unfortunately this does 
not work. In line 253 of class Authenticator (method: authenticate(HttpMethod, 
HttpState, Header, String)) I see this comment:

    // FIXME: Note that this won't work if there is more than one realm within 
the challenge

so it looks like this is something that isn't yet implemented. In the log, I 
can see that the Authenticator attempts to parse the realm, but it looks like
this is not being done correctly:

   411 DEBUG Attempting to authenticate challenge: Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM, 
Basic realm="10.105.20.201"

   411 DEBUG Parsed realm "ealm="10.105.20.201" from challenge "NTLM, Basic 
realm="10.105.20.201"".
   421 WARN  Exception thrown authenticating
java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Authentication type "NTLM," is not 
recognized.

It looks wrong to me that the realm name seems to be parsed as: 
ealm="10.105.20.201

I understand that Authenticator does not know what NTLM is but I would like it 
to use Basic authentication in this case.

If there are more authentication methods possible, how can I specify which one 
I want to use?
