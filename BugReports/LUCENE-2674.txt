improve how MTQs interact with the terms dict cache



Description:
Some small improvements:

  * Adds a TermsEnum.cacheCurrentTerm "hint" (codec can make this a no-op)

  * Removes the FTE.useTermsCache

  * Changes MTQ's TermCollector API to accept the TermsEnum so collectors can eg call .docFreq directly

  * Adds expert ctor to TermQuery allowing you to pass in the docFreq
