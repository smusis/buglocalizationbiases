optimize contrib/regex for flex



Description:
* changes RegexCapabilities match(String) to match(BytesRef)
* the jakarta and jdk impls uses CharacterIterator/CharSequence matching against the utf16result instead.
* i also reuse the matcher for jdk, i don't see why we didnt do this before but it makes sense esp since we reuse the CSQ
