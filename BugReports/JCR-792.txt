after enabling access manager, I can't createNode and setProperty without a node.save in the middle



Description:
I added my own access manager. after that I can't get the following code working 

Node n = createNewNode(parentNode);
n.setProperty();
parentNode.save();

It seems that setProperty will invoke access control check, but since the new node is not in the repository yet, my access manager implementation won't be able to grant permission. I also tried to use hierachyManager to get the path of the new node, it also returned null.
