IndexReader overwrites future commits when you open it on a past commit



Description:
Hit this on trying to build up a test index for perf testing...

IndexReader (and Writer) accept an IndexCommit on open.

This is quite powerful, because, if you use a deletion policy that keeps multiple commits around, you can open a not-current commit, make some changes, write a new commit, all without altering the "future" commits.

I use this to first build up a big wikipedia index, including one commit w/ multiple segments, then another commit after optimize(), and then I open an writable IR to perform deletions off of both those commits.  This gives me a single test index that has all four combinations (single vs multi segment; deletions vs no deletions).

But IndexReader has a bug whereby it overwrites the segments_N file.  (IndexWriter works correctly).
