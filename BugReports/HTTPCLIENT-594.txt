HttpMethodBase#aborted variable mistakenly declared transient instead of volatile



Description:
HttpMethodBase#aborted variable mistakenly declared transient instead of volatile. This is quite nasty. 

Do we want to cut an emergency release (3.0.2) because of that or can this wait until 3.1-beta1?

Fix attached.
