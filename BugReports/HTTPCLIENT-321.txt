wrong charset indication in HttpConstants.getContentString()



Description:
Around line 236 in HttpConstants.getConstentString() the charset is wrongly indicated as 
"DEFAULT_CONTENT_CHARSET" where it should have been indicated as "charset" like in the 
getContentBytes function.

            if (LOG.isWarnEnabled()) {
                LOG.warn("Unsupported encoding: " 
                    + DEFAULT_CONTENT_CHARSET // <== should be the variable "charset" here
                    + ". Default HTTP encoding used");
            }

Wrong copy/paste I guess :-)
