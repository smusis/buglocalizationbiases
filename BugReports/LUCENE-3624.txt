Throw exception for "Multi-SortedSource" instead of returning null



Description:
Spinoff of LUCENE-3623: currently if you addIndexes(FIR) or similar, you get a NPE deep within codecs during merge.

I think the NPE is confusing, it looks like a bug but a clearer exception would be an improvement.
