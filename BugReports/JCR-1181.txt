Use common base classes in jackrabbit-core and jcr2spi



Description:
As part of JCR-742 I've implemented a number of generic JCR base classes and adapters in org.apache.jackrabbit.commons. These classes are based on existing code in jackrabbit-core.

To encourage code reuse across jackrabbit-core and jcr2spi, I'd like to make both components use these generic base classes.
