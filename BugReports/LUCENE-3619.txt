in trunk if you switch up omitNorms while indexing, you get a corrumpt norms file



Description:
document 1 has 
  body: norms=true
  title: norms=true
document 2 has 
  body: norms=false
  title: norms=true

when seeing 'body' for the first time, normswriterperfield gets 'initial fieldinfo' and 
saves it away, which says norms=true

however, at flush time we dont check, so we write the norms happily anyway.
then SegmentReader reads the norms later: it skips "body" since it omits norms
and if you ask for the norms of 'title' it instead returns the bogus "body" norms.

asserting that SegmentReader "plans to" read the whole .nrm file exposes the bug.
