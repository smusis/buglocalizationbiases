GData - Server wrong commit does not build



Description:
The last GData - Server commit  does not build due to a wrong commit.
Yonik did not commit all the files in the diff file. There are several sources and packages missing.
  
The diff - file with the date of 26.06.06 should be applied.
--> http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-598
26.06.06.diff (644 kb)

could any of the lucene committers apply this patch. Yonik is on the way to Dublin.

Thanks Simon
