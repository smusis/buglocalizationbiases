EventConsumer.canRead() should rely on AccessManager.isGranted()



Description:
The current implementation of EventConsumer.canRead() uses
AccessManager.canRead(), which might cause issues if the item
does not exist anymore. AccessManager.isGranted() explicitly
mentions and supports checks on paths for items that do not
yet exist or not exist anymore.
