move deletes under codec



Description:
After LUCENE-3631, this should be easier I think.

I haven't looked at it much myself but i'll play around a bit, but at a glance:
* SegmentReader to have Bits liveDocs instead of BitVector
* address the TODO in the IW-using ctors so that SegmentReader doesn't take a parent but just an existing core.
* we need some type of minimal "MutableBits" or similar subinterface of bits. BitVector and maybe Fixed/OpenBitSet could implement it
* BitVector becomes an impl detail and moves to codec (maybe we have a shared base class and split the 3.x/4.x up rather than the conditional backwards)
* I think the invertAll should not be used by IndexWriter, instead we define the codec interface to say "give me a new MutableBits, by default all are set" ?
* redundant internally-consistent checks in checkLiveCounts should be done in the codec impl instead of in SegmentReader.
* plain text impl in SimpleText.
