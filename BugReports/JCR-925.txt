Incorrect transitive snapshot dependencies



Description:
Using ${version} in dependency declarations causes troubles since for snapshot dependencies the version variable apparently gets replaced by the exact timestamp of a deployed snapshot instead of the "x.y-SNAPSHOT" string. Typically the timestamps of different artifacts are not the same, causing broken dependencies.
