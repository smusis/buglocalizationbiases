Connection timeout logic redesign



Description:
Changelog:

* CreateSocket method with timeout parameter added to the ProtocolSocketFactory
interface

* TimeoutController related code factored out of HttpConnection class and moved
into ControllerThreadSocketFactory helper class

* ReflectionSocketFactory helper class added. This factory encapsulates
reflection code to call JDK 1.4 Socket#connect method if supported

* All protocol socket factories now attempt to initially use
ReflectionSocketFactory if required to create a socket within a given limit of
time. If reflection fails protocol socket factories fall back onto the good ol'
ControllerThreadSocketFactory

Benefits:

* HttpConnection code got a lot cleaner
* When running in modern JREs expensive timeout controller thread per connection
attempt is no longer needed
* Ugly code intended to work around limitations of the older JREs is now
confined to a few helper classes that can be easily thrown away once we move
onto Java 1.4

Let me know what you think
