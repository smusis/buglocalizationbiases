Lucene Search not scalling



Description:
I've noticed that when doing thousands of searches in a single thread the average time is quite low i.e. a few milliseconds. When adding more concurrent searches doing exactly the same search the average time increases drastically. 
I've profiled the search classes and found that the whole of lucene blocks on 

org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentCoreReaders.getTermsReader
org.apache.lucene.util.VirtualMethod
  public synchronized int getImplementationDistance 
org.apache.lucene.util.AttributeSourcew.getAttributeInterfaces

These cause search times to increase from a few milliseconds to up to 2 seconds when doing 500 concurrent searches on the same in memory index. Note: That the index is not being updates at all, so not refresh methods are called at any stage.


Some questions:
  Why do we need synchronization here?
  There must be a non-lockable solution for these, they basically cause lucene to be ok for single thread applications but disastrous for any concurrent implementation.

I'll do some experiments by removing the synchronization from the methods of these classes.
