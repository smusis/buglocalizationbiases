Query for string literal broken when literal can be coerced into other type



Description:
When a string literal can be coerced into another type (e.g. integer) a property of type string that matches the literal is not found.

E.g. the following query will match prop if its value is the string '1234'.
//*[@prop = '1234']

The query should match properties with string value '1234' and integer value 1234.
