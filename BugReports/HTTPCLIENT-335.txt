Handling sub-domain cookies.



Description:
I noticed a difference in behaviour between httpclient and most common browsers 
(IE/Mozilla). If a web site sets a cookie for "beta.gamma.com", this cookie is 
not sent in requests to "alpha.beta.gamma.com". 
  I am not sure what the cookie specs say, but Mozilla, IE and even 
HTTP::Cookies module in LWP seem to behave differently from HttpClient. 
HttpClient seems to rely on the leading dot in the domain name 
(like ".beta.gamma.com").
