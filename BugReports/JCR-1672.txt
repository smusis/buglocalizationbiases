Adding Event interface and isLocal()



Description:
when a repository cluster is used, it seems that a common problem many people have is to detect if an observation event is send because of changes on the local instance or a remote instance of the cluster.

This is especially important if you want to do post processing of data
based on observation (the post processing should only be done by one instance in the cluster).

A current solution is to cast the jcr event object to the EventImpl of jackrabbit core which is obviously not a nice solution :)

So what about adding an event interface to jackrabbit api which extends the jcr event interface and adds the isLocal() method?
