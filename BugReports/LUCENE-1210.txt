IndexWriter & ConcurrentMergeScheduler deadlock case if starting a merge hits an exception



Description:
If you're using CMS (the default) and mergeInit hits an exception (eg
OOME), we are not properly clearing IndexWriter's internal tracking of
running merges.  This causes IW.close() to hang while it incorrectly
waits for these non-started merges to finish.
