Graduate appendingcodec from contrib/misc



Description:
* All tests pass with this codec (at least once, maybe we don't test that two-phase commit stuff very well!)
* It doesn't require special client side configuration anymore to work (just set it on indexwriter and go)
* it now works with the compound file format.

I don't think it needs to live in contrib anymore.
