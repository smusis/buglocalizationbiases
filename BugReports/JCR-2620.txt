Authorizable#getProperty and #setProperty should deal with relativePath 



Description:
Authorizable#getProperty and #setProperty defines the property to be identified by a name.

The JCR item based implementation could easily deal with relative paths instead and also retrieve or write properties below child
nodes of the rep:Authorizable node.
