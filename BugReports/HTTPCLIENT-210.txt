Exception handling in HttpClient requires redesign



Description:
When I use httpclient2.0-alpha3 and setTimeout(60000), after the specified 
time, I would like to see InterruptedIOException thrown, but I got 
HttpRecoverableException instead, which is pretty general. I would like to see 
the original exception. Thanks
