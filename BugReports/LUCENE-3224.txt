bugs in ByteArrayDataInput



Description:
ByteArrayDataInput has a byte[] ctor, but it doesn't actually work (some things like readVint will work, others will fail due to asserts).

The problem is it doesnt set things like limit in the ctor... I think the ctor should call reset()
Most code using this passes null to the ctor to initialize it, then uses reset(), instead they could just call ByteArrayInput(BytesRef.EMPTY_BYTES) if they want to do that.
finally, reset()'s limit looks like it should be offset + len
