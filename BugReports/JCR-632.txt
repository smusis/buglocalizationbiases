VersionManager lock not released in some circumstances



Description:
In some circumstances it is possible that lock is not released in VersionManager.checkin method.

There is following block of code in checkin nethod :

        aquireReadLock();
        try {
              .....
        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {
            releaseReadLock();
            throw new RepositoryException("Unable to start edit operation.");
        }

Lock release should be in finally block to make sure that lock is released when unexpected exception is thrown.
In our environment we are getting NPE in mentioned block of code, it results in persisten lock. 
No versioning operation is possible and our application server is running ot of threads (all threads are locked).
