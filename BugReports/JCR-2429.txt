Clustering is broken due to duplicated CachingPersistenceManager interface



Description:
There are now two interfaces CachingPersistenceManager in the packages org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle and org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.pool. A persistence manager that implements the ..bundle... interface doesn't receive the onExternalUpdate events that are required for clustering to work.

I will move this interface to the package org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence and remove the second implementation.

This change has no affect to backward compatibility, because anyway there were many breaking changes in the past (NodeId / UUID for example).
