RMIC not working in subprojects when compiling parent using maven2



Description:
This is because there is a bug such that if you have a child build which uses the ant plugin it inherits the plugin dependencies of the first time the plugin is declared.

The workaround is to put the antrun plugin in the toplevel, and add the java jar to its plugin dependencies.
