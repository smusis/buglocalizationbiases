httpclient build requires jdk 1.4 or jce in classpath



Description:
Currently when a 'ant dist'
is performed httpclient is looking for javax.crypt.* which is in jce.jar

The build.xml and build.properties.sample need to be patched
so they allow the jce.jar file to be specified
just like the jsse.jar is specified.

will attach two patch files made from todays cvs
