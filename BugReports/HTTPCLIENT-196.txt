httpClient failed to reconnect after keep-alive connection timed out



Description:
Description:

When using httpClient with https tunnelling througha proxy server, after keep-
alive connection timed out on server side.  The httpClient code was unable to 
establish the connection again.

Cause:

The HttpMethodBase.processRequest's retry loop retries the connection without 
going through the "CONNECT" request to the proxy server.  Our proxy server 
returns 407 error code.  In case of tunnelling connection, proper reconnect 
should be done by first doing the "CONNECT" sequence to get authenticated 
throught the proxy.

Temp fix and Work around:

We implemented some work around to do the retry from the application layer.  In 
order to detect the situation, we have to rely on the error message contained 
in the HttpRecoverableException.  We are checking the text "Connection aborted 
by peer: socket write error".  We also have to modify the HttpMethodBase code 
to throw the HttpRecoverableException out to the application.
