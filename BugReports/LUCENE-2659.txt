lucenetestcase ease of use improvements



Description:
I started working on this in LUCENE-2658, here is the finished patch.

There are some problems with LuceneTestCase:
* a tests beforeClass, or the test itself (its @befores and its method), might have some
  random behavior, but only the latter can be reproduced with -Dtests.seed
* if you want to do things in beforeClass, you have to use a different API: newDirectory(random)
  instead of newDirectory, etc.
* for a new user, the current output can be verbose, confusing and overwhelming.

So, I refactored this class to address these problems. 
A class still needs 2 seeds internally, as the beforeClass will only run once, 
but the methods or setUp() might run many times, especially when increasing iterations.

but lucenetestcase deals with this, and the "seed" is 128-bit (UUID): 
the MSB is initialized in beforeClass, the LSB varied for each method run.
if you provide a seed with a -D, they are both fixed to the UUID you provided.

I fixed the API to be consistent, so you should be able to migrate a test from 
setUp() to beforeClass() [junit3 to junit4] without changing parameters.

The codec, locale, timezone is only printed once at the end if any tests fail, 
as its per-class anyway (setup in beforeClass)

finally, when a test fails, you get a single "reproduce with" command line you can copy and paste to reproduce.
this way you dont have to spend time trying to figure out what the command line should be.
