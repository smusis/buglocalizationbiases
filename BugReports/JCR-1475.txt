Inconsistency when version with a label is removed



Description:
While executing random operations on the version storage I came across a situation where a version is removed that has a version label.

The current behaviour in jackrabbit is IMO not correct because the version node gets removed, but the version label is still present in the version history. This means there is a referenceable property that points to nowhere.

So I guess either:

- the version label property must be removed as well when the version is removed
or
- the remove version operation should fail because the version is still referenced

I wasn't able to find a relevant section in the spec, though I must admit that I don't know the versioning section that well.
