Update dependency versions for commons-collections, slf4j and derby



Description:
Some of the dependencies used by the 2.0-beta1 could be upgraded:
commons-collections from 3.1 to 3.2.1
slf4j from 1.5.3 to 1.5.8
derby from 10.2.1.6 to 10.5.3.0

Not sure about derby but the other two seems to be just drop in replacements for their older verisons.
