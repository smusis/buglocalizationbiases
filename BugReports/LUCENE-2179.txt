CharArraySet.clear()



Description:
I needed CharArraySet.clear() for something I was working on in Solr in a tokenstream.

instead I ended up using CharArrayMap<Boolean> because it supported .clear()

it would be better to use a set though, currently it will throw UOE for .clear() because AbstractSet will call iterator.remove() which throws UOE.

In Solr, the very similar CharArrayMap.clear() looks like this:
{code}
  @Override
  public void clear() {
    count = 0;
    Arrays.fill(keys,null);
    Arrays.fill(values,null);
  }
{code}

I think we can do a similar thing as long as we throw UOE for the UnmodifiableCharArraySet

will submit a patch later tonight (unless someone is bored and has nothing better to do)
