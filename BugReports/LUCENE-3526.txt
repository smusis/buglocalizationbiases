preflex codec returns wrong terms if you use an empty field name



Description:
spinoff from LUCENE-3473.

I have a standalone test for this... the termsenum is returning a bogus extra empty-term (I assume it has no postings, i didnt try).

This causes the checkindex test in LUCENE-3473 to fail, because there are 4 terms instead of 3.
