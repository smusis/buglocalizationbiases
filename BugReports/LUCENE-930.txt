fail build if contrib tests fail to compile



Description:
spinoff of LUCENE-885, from Steven's comments...

Looking at the current build (r545324) it looks like the some contrib failures are getting swallowed. Things like lucli are throwing errors along the lines of

 [subant] /home/barronpark/smparkes/work/lucene/trunk/common-build.xml:366: srcdir "/home/barronpark/smparkes/work/lucene/trunk/contrib/lucli/src/test" does not exist!

but these don't make it back up to the top level status.

It looks like the current state will bubble up junit failures, but maybe not build failures?

...

It's "test-compile-contrib" (if you will) that fails and rather being contrib-crawled, that's only done as the target of "test" in each contrib directory, at which point, it's running in the protected contrib-crawl.

Easy enough to lift this loop into another target, e.g., build-contrib-test. And that will start surfacing errors, which I can work through.
