Missing Content-Length header causes a SocketException



Description:
Essentially, we have an invalid HTTP server (Stellent CMS actually and we will file a bug with them), 
which is returning headers like:

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic "Secure Realm"
Connection: keep-alive

Which is clearly missing the Content-Length header.  Now, previously HttpClient handled this 
perfectly by reading until the end of the connection (ie: treating it like it was a Connection: close), 
however for some reason a socket exception is being thrown and the invalid connection is added 
back into the connection pool and then every connection to the server after that thows an 
exception.

See the thread "SocketException with invalid server" for the full discussion of the issue.

I'll attach a patch that fixes the problem.  The biggest thing to consider is the changes to the 
duplicate Connection header test cases which resolves around the question: if Connection: keep-
alive is present but no Content-Length is provided, should the connection be closed?  The patch 
requires the answer to be yes and I really can't see any other way to do it.
