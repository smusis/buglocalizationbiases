Improvements to user management



Description:
Container issue for various improvements needed for the user management implementation in jr-core.

Known improvements are:

- extensibility
- current structuring of users/groups in the JCR content doesn't allow for easy finding user/group by ID.
- groupID should be unescaped before being returned by getID
