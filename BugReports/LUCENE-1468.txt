FSDirectory.list() is inconsistent



Description:
LUCENE-638 added a check to the FSDirectory.list() method to only return files that are Lucene related. I think this change made the FSDirectory implementation inconsistent with all other methods in Directory. E.g. you can create a file with an arbitrary name using FSDirectory, fileExists() will report that it is there, deleteFile() will remove it, but the array returned by list() will not contain the file.

The actual issue that was reported in LUCENE-638 was about sub directories. Those should clearly not be listed, but IMO it is not the responsibility of a Directory implementation to decide what kind of files can be created or listed. The Directory class is an abstraction of a directory and it should't to more than that.
