Reduce number of different repository.xml present with jackrabbit-core



Description:
while taking a look at the repository configuration and the related test-cases, i saw that there are quite some repository.xml files around... which i think is a bit confusion and probably hard to maintain once we make
changes to the config.

i would to suggest to consolidate that and - if possible - get rid of some of them.
if we can't i would suggest to put some comment in every of the different configuration files indicating
what they are used for.

from what i've seen so far (still missing complete overview)

1) http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit-core/src/main/config/repository.xml

    Current comment: <!-- Example Repository Configuration File -->
    Usage: ??

2) http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/test-repository.xml

   current comment: -  
   Used as repository configuration in org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TestRepository.java

   Used by org.apache.jackrabbit.core.config.RepositoryConfigTest.java in order to create another repository.xml 
   under target/test-repository.xml. a bit confusing given the fact, that a test-repository.xml exists as well. I would
   suggest to rename the REPOSITORY_XML constant in RepositoryConfigTest.


4) http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit-core/src/test/repository/repository.xml

   current comment: <!-- Example Repository Configuration File -->
   Usage: i assume, that is the one referenced in test/resources/repositoryStubImpl.properties
