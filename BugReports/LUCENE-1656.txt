When sorting by field, IndexSearcher should not compute scores by default



Description:
In 2.9 we've added the ability to turn off scoring (maxScore &
trackScores, separately) when sorting by field.

I expect most apps don't use the scores when sorting by field, and
there's a sizable performance gain when scoring is off, so I think for
2.9 we should not score by default, and add show in CHANGES how to
enable scoring if you rely on it.

If there are no objections, I'll commit that change in a day or two
(it's trivial).
