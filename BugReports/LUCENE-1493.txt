Enable setting hits queue size in Search*Task in contrib/benchmark



Description:
In testing for LUCENE-1483, I'd like to try different collector queue
sizes during benchmarking.  But currently contrib/benchmark uses
deprecated Hits with hardwired "top 100" queue size.  I'll switch it to
the TopDocs APIs.
