CartesianPolyFilterBuilder doesn't handle edge case around the 180 meridian



Description:
Test case:  
Points all around the globe, plus two points at 0, 179.9 and 0,-179.9 (on each side of the meridian).  Then, do a Cartesian Tier filter on a point right near those two.  It will return all the points when it should just return those two.

The flawed logic is in the else clause below:
{code}
if (longX2 != 0.0) {
		//We are around the prime meridian
		if (longX == 0.0) {
			longX = longX2;
			longY = 0.0;
        	shape = getShapeLoop(shape,ctp,latX,longX,latY,longY);
		} else {//we are around the 180th longitude
			longX = longX2;
			longY = -180.0;
			shape = getShapeLoop(shape,ctp,latY,longY,latX,longX);
	}
{code}

Basically, the Y and X values are transposed.  This currently says go from longY (-180) all the way around  to longX which is the lower left longitude of the box formed.  Instead, it should go from the lower left long to -180.
