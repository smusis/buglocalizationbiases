RequestWrapper does not use the headers of the request it wraps.



Description:
The RequestWrapper does not use the headers of the request it wraps. Therefore the wrapper appears as having no header, while the wrapped request may have some.

To work-around that behavior, I have to call resetHeaders() on the wrapper just after having created it.
This method does the following:
    public void resetHeaders()
    {
        headergroup.clear();
        setHeaders(original.getAllHeaders());
    }

I suggest calling setHeaders directly in the constructor. Or at least highlight in the Javadoc that we should call resetHeaders().
