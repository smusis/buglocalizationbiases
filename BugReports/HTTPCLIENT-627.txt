overhaul connection manager and associated connection interface



Description:
MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager/HttpHostConnection needs to be overhauled to provide a layer on top of OperatedClientConnection.
Preliminary working names: ThreadSafeClientConnManager/ManagedClientConnection

This implies some work on former HttpMethodDirector and HttpClient to verify completeness of the new connection management API.
