Cookie.parse exception when parsing expiry date in single quotes



Description:
A Netscape-Enterprise/3.6 SP3 server sends a cookie where the parameter expires='Thu, 05-Dec-
2002 12:07:45 GMT'. 
Cookie.parse throws an exception because none of the four built-in formats 
matches - I have tested that the parse code works OK if the single quotes are omitted from the value 
being parsed.

Resolution: If the value of the 'expires' parameter starts and ends with a 
single quote then strip the first and last character before parsing.
