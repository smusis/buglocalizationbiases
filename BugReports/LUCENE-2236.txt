Similarity can only be set per index, but I may want to adjust scoring behaviour at a field level



Description:
Similarity can only be set per index, but I may want to adjust scoring behaviour at a field level, to faciliate this could we pass make field name available to all score methods.
Currently it is only passed to some such as lengthNorm() but not others such as tf()
