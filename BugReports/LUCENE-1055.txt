Remove GData from trunk 



Description:
GData doesn't seem to be maintained anymore. We're going to remove it before we cut the 2.3 release unless there are negative votes.

In case someones jumps in in the future and starts to maintain it, we can re-add it to the trunk.

If anyone is using GData and needs it to be in 2.3 please let us know soon!
