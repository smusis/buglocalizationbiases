Repository is not unlocked if version manager init failed and assertions are enabled



Description:
The following test case will work as expected, except when assertions are enabled (java -ea ...):

Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(
        "jdbc:derby:repository/version/db;create=true");
Statement stat = conn.createStatement();
stat.execute("create table version_bundle(id int)");
TransientRepository rep = new TransientRepository();
try {
    rep.login(new SimpleCredentials("", new char[0]));
} catch (Exception e) {
    // ignore
}
rep.shutdown();
stat.execute("drop table version_bundle");
new TransientRepository().login(new SimpleCredentials("", new char[0]));

The reason is the assertion in RepositoryContext.getInternalVersionManager. Because of this assertion, the repository lock is not released during the repository shutdown.
