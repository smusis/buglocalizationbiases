convert automaton to char[] based processing and TermRef / TermsEnum api



Description:
The automaton processing is currently done with String, mostly because TermEnum is based on String.
it is easy to change the processing to work with char[], since behind the scenes this is used anyway.

in general I think we should make sure char[] based processing is exposed in the automaton pkg anyway, for things like pattern-based tokenizers and such.
