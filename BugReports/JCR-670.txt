LocalNamespaceMappings does not make use of NameCache in NamespaceRegistryImpl



Description:
This basically means that the NameCache in NamespaceRegistryImpl is never used.

The LocalNamespaceMappings should also implement NameCache and forward calls to the NamespaceRegistryImpl for names
with namespace URIs that are not locally remapped. See proposed patch.
