Lucene RAM Directory doesn't work for Index Size > 8 GB

Problem seems to be casting issues in RAMInputStream.

Line 90:
      bufferStart = BUFFER_SIZE * currentBufferIndex;
both rhs are ints while lhs is long.
so a very large product would first overflow MAX_INT, become negative, and only then (auto) casted to long, but this is too late. 

Line 91: 
     bufferLength = (int) (length - bufferStart);
both rhs are longs while lhs is int.
so the (int) cast result may turn negative and the logic that follows would be wrong.
