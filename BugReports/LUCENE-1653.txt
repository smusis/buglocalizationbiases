Change DateTools to not create a Calendar in every call to dateToString or timeToString



Description:
DateTools creates a Calendar instance on every call to dateToString and timeToString. Specifically:

# timeToString calls Calendar.getInstance on every call.
# dateToString calls timeToString(date.getTime()), which then instantiates a new Date(). I think we should change the order of the calls, or not have each call the other.
# round(), which is called from timeToString (after creating a Calendar instance) creates another (!) Calendar instance ...

Seems that if we synchronize the methods and create the Calendar instance once (static), it should solve it.
