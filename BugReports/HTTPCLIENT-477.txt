There is no way to specify a different auth scheme priority for host and proxy



Description:
Using HttpClient 3.0 rc2, you cannot authenticate to a site using Basic
Autentication and to a proxy server using NTLM authentication.

When you indicate a prefference to use NTLM over Basic authentication the
authentication will fail when it tries to authenticate NTML to the Proxy and to
the Site. If you indicate Basic, then NTLM authentication order the Basic
authentication will fail when used for the Proxy (since basic authentication
can't send the domain name it fails).

The email thread from the discussion group is pasted below for refference.

Hi all,
I am trying to authenticate to a server via a proxy which also requires
authentication. It seems that I can get either the proxy authentication to work
OR the site authentication to work, but not both.

Both seem to work independently when I set the credentials (or proxy
credentials) using NTCredentials (e.g. if I connect to the site from a network
not using a proxy I can get it to work, and I can authenticate to the proxy only
to get a 401 authentication failed from the server when using the proxy).

I read in the Authentication tutorial that you can't authenticate using NTLM to
both the proxy and site, so I'm trying various combinations of authentication,
but I can't find any documentation that specifically covers this case and I feel
like I'm just taking stabs in the dark right now.

If anyone can point me in the direction of the light at the end of the tunnel
I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
David

David,

You _really_ can't use NTLM to authenticate with the proxy and the
target host at the same, due to the nature of this authentication
scheme. Really. That was not a joke.

Please consider using one of the following combinations instead:

(1) BASIC proxy + NTLM host if both the clent and the proxy are within a
trusted network segment

(2) NTLM proxy + SSL + BASIC host

Both combinations should provide an adequate (or better in the latter case)
security

Hope this helps

Oleg

Thanks for the reply Oleg. This is what I figured, but I cannot see how to use
different authentication schemes for the Proxy vs. the Site authentication
challenge.

I tried adding the code suggested in the Authentication tutorial:

        List authPrefs = new ArrayList(2);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.DIGEST);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.BASIC);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.NTLM);
         This will exclude the NTLM authentication scheme
        httpclient.getParams().setParameter(AuthPolicy.AUTH_SCHEME_PRIORITY,
authPrefs);

I got a message stating that it was attempting BASIC authentication for the
Proxy and that it failed (probably because the domain doesn't get passed I
guess). So my thought is that I need NTLM for the proxy authentication and Basic
will work for the site authentication.

The question I am then working on is how to direct the HttpClient to select that
order of authentication methods. If I let it take NTLM as the preffered
authentication method then it will try to authenticate both challenges with NTLM.

I sure there is just some little detail I'm missing here somewhere, it's just
hard to find it.

Thanks a lot!

David,

I see the problem. This will require a patch and a new parameter.
Luckily the preference API introduced in HttpClient 3.0 allows up to add
parameters quite easily. Please file a feature request with Bugzilla
ASAP and I'll do my best to hack up a patch before I leave for holidays
(that is Friday, July 1st)

Hi Oleg, thanks, I'll put that request in today.
This helps a lot, at least I know I'm on the right path now.

I am attempting to devise a workaround for this by handling the authentication
manually (setDoAuthentication(false)).

When I see a 401 error I am processing a basic authentication with the site
credentials, when I see a 407 error I want to process an NTLM authentication
with the proxy credentials.

To that end I have the following code that runs after
httpclient.execute(getmethod) executes. The code below works perfectly for the
basic authentication (when the proxy is not in the picture).

In looking up the Handshake of the NTLM authentication I see that I have a
problem with the code below since the handshake includes 2 challenge and
authorization steps before the authentication succeeds. I'm not clear how I
could manually authenticate the NTLM response. I would expect the NTLMScheme
class to contain a Type 1 and Type 3 authenticate() method for processing both
challenge responses. Is there another way of processing the NTLM authentication
after receiving the initial authentication challenge from the server?

        //Check for Proxy or Site authentication
        if(getmethod.getStatusCode() == 401){
            //Authenticate to the site using Basic authentication.
            BasicScheme basicscheme = new BasicScheme();
            String basic_auth_string = basicscheme.authenticate(new
NTCredentials("cwftp", "664A754c", "", ""), getmethod);
            Header basic_auth_header = new Header("Authorization",
basic_auth_string);
            getmethod.addRequestHeader(basic_auth_header);
            try{
                httpclient.executeMethod(getmethod);
            }catch(Exception e){
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "ack!!!!", e);
            }
            return getmethod;
       }else if(getmethod.getStatusCode() == 407){
            //Authenticate to the site using Basic authentication
            NTLMScheme ntlmscheme = new NTLMScheme();
            String basic_auth_string = ntlmscheme.authenticate(new
NTCredentials("00mercbac", "!@SAMmerc2004", "simproxy", "CFC"), getmethod);
            Header basic_auth_header = new Header("Authorization",
basic_auth_string);
            getmethod.addRequestHeader(basic_auth_header);
            try{
                httpclient.executeMethod(getmethod);
            }catch(Exception e){
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE, "ack!!!!", e);
            }
            return getmethod;
       }


Thanks,
David
