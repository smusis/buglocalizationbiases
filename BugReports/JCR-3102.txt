InternalVersion.getFrozenNode confused about root version?



Description:
It seems the javadoc for InternalVersion.getFrozenNode  is confused:

     * Returns the frozen node of this version or <code>null</code> if this is
     * the root version.

AFAIU, the frozen node of the root version is always present to capture the node type of the versionable node.

Does anybody recall how this got here? (SVN says it has been there forever)
