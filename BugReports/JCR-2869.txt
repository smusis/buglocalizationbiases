AccessControlManager#setPolicy may fail for new applicable policy despite jcr:modifyAccessControl privilege being granted



Description:
the sequence AccessControlManager.getApplicablePolicies -> modify -> AccessControlManager#setPolicy fails
due to bug in AC evaluation if target is an AC-item but not yet existing. in this case the
wrong parent node is used for AC-evaluation.
