Crashes when it gets a redirect



Description:
I get the following crash when VFS (not my code) calls HttpClient. This code 
worked with some older version of HttpClient (is my belief) but doesn't appear 
to work with CVS HEAD, hence this posting.

Note: I'm sorry, but I don't know which Method it was calling, but hopefully a 
redirect is a redirect and the bug stands irrespective of that.

This is major to me (and Ruper) 'cos it is the first thing it does before 
attempting to read the contents of that location.

regards,

Adam
