RepositoryService.checkin should return information about newly created version



Description:
We have a mismatch between Node.checkin(), which returns a new Version object, and RepositoryService.checkin(), which returns void.

Client of SPI, such as JCR2SPI, thus will have to make an additional request for the base version property, with the obvious drawbacks (another call, and a potential cause for a race condition).

Proposal: change the return code to NodeId.
