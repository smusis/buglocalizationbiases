Adding same IndexDocValuesField twice trips assert



Description:
Doc values fields are single-valued by design, ie a given field name can only occur once in the document.

But if you accidentally add it more than once, you get an assert error, which is spooky because if you run w/o asserts maybe something eviler happens.

I think we should explicitly check for this and throw clear exc since user could easily do this by accident.
