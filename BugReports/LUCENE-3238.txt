SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper with Prefix Query issue



Description:
If we try to do a search with SpanQuery and a PrefixQuery this message is returned:

"You can only use SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper with a suitable SpanRewriteMethod."

The problem is in the WildcardQuery rewrite function.

If the wildcard query is a prefix, a new prefix query is created, the rewrite method is set with the SpanRewriteMethod and the prefix query is returned.

But, that's the rewritten prefix query which should be returned:

-      return rewritten;
+      return rewritten.rewrite(reader);

I will attach a patch with a unit test included.
