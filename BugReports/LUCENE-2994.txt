When 3.1 is released, update backwards tests in 3.x branch



Description:
When we have released the official artifacts of Lucene 3.1 (the final ones!!!), we need to do the following:

- svn rm backwards/src/test
- svn cp https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/dev/branches/lucene_solr_3_1/lucene/src/test backwards/src/test
- Copy the lucene-core-3.1.0.jar from the last release tarball to lucene/backwards/lib and delete old one.
- Check that everything is correct: The backwards folder should contain a src/ folder that now contains "test". The files should be the ones from the branch.
- Run "ant test-backwards"

Uwe will take care of this!
