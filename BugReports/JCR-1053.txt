Calling size method of a ManageableArrayList causes NullPointerException



Description:
When using the NTCollectionConverterImpl with proxy="true" a call on the size () method of a ManageableArrayList causes a NullPointerException if there is no underlying List. LazyCollectionLoader doLoad returns null because there is are no children.

The ManageableArrayList is created because the isNull method of the NTCollectionConverterImpl class always returns false. 
According to the comment line this is done because the getCollectionNodes always returns a list. 
But after the fix for JCR-882 this is not correct anymore.

The attached fix corrects this. 

The only question remaining is how to differ between an empty list and a null-value for the field containing the list.
