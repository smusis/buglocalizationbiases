JCR2SPI: Add specific deep loading of Nodes and Properties



Description:
with jcr2spi an item is 'deep' loaded whenever the hierarchy is not complete. while for Session#itemExists or Session#getItem it is ok to try loading a Node first and if not found a Property, this is inconvenient (and generates unnecessary round trips to the SPI) for those cases, where the original JCR call indicates whether a Node or Property is expected.

This is the case for Node.getNode(String relPath) and Node.getProperty(String relPath) ((and maybe others))

Therefore i suggest to add specific methods

HierarchyManager#getNodeEntry
HierarchyManager#getPropertyEntry
NodeEntry#getDeepNodeEntry
NodeEntry#getDeepPropertyEntry

(or something similar)
