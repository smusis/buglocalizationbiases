Simplify NRTManager



Description:
NRTManager is hairy now, because the applyDeletes is separately passed
to ctor, passed to maybeReopen, passed to getSearcherManager, etc.

I think, instead, you should pass it only to the ctor, and if you have
some cases needing deletes and others not then you can make two
NRTManagers.  This should be no less efficient than we have today,
just simpler.

I think it will also enable NRTManager to subclass ThingyManager
(LUCENE-3761).
