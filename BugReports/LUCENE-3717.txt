Add fake charfilter to BaseTokenStreamTestCase to find offsets bugs



Description:
Recently lots of issues have been fixed about broken offsets, but it would be nice to improve the
test coverage and test that they work across the board (especially with charfilters).

in BaseTokenStreamTestCase.checkRandomData, we can sometimes pass the analyzer a reader wrapped
in a "MockCharFilter" (the one in the patch sometimes doubles characters). If the analyzer does
not call correctOffsets or does incorrect "offset math" (LUCENE-3642, etc) then eventually
this will create offsets and the test will fail.

Other than tests bugs, this found 2 real bugs: ICUTokenizer did not call correctOffset() in its end(),
and ThaiWordFilter did incorrect offset math.
