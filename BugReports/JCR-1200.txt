allow SPI implementation to compute default values for autocreated properties



Description:
Currently, when creating nodes in transient space, JCR2SPI uses hard-wired logic trying to populate system generated properties such as jcr:created, jcr;uuid and so on.

This is problematic as

- it doesn't scale -- it fails for autocreated properties not known to JCR2SPI, and

- the syntax for the defaults may be dependant on the back end, such as legal syntax for (UU)IDs.

Proposal:

- extend QValueFactory with something like

  QValue computeDefaultValue(QPropertyDefinition)

- use that in JCR2SPI, getting rid of the currently hard-wired logic.
