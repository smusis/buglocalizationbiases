Prevent logins during repository shutdown



Description:
Related to the last comment in JCR-445, should we prevent new sessions from being created during repository shutdown? It is an odd chance to run into a problem like that, but it seems like the issue could be easily solved by making getWorkspaceInfo() synchronized and adding sanityCheck() calls to the createSession() methods.
