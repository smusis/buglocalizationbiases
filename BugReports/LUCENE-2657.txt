Replace Maven POM templates with full POMs, and change documentation accordingly



Description:
The current Maven POM templates only contain dependency information, the bare bones necessary for uploading artifacts to the Maven repository.

The full Maven POMs in the attached patch include the information necessary to run a multi-module Maven build, in addition to serving the same purpose as the current POM templates.

Several dependencies are not available through public maven repositories.  A profile in the top-level POM can be activated to install these dependencies from the various {{lib/}} directories into your local repository.  From the top-level directory:

{code}
mvn -N -Pbootstrap install
{code}

Once these non-Maven dependencies have been installed, to run all Lucene/Solr tests via Maven's surefire plugin, and populate your local repository with all artifacts, from the top level directory, run:

{code}
mvn install
{code}

When one Lucene/Solr module depends on another, the dependency is declared on the *artifact(s)* produced by the other module and deposited in your local repository, rather than on the other module's un-jarred compiler output in the {{build/}} directory, so you must run {{mvn install}} on the other module before its changes are visible to the module that depends on it.

To create all the artifacts without running tests:

{code}
mvn -DskipTests install
{code}

I almost always include the {{clean}} phase when I do a build, e.g.:

{code}
mvn -DskipTests clean install
{code}
