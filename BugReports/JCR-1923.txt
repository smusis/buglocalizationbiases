Startup fails if clustered jackrabbit is upgrade from 1.4.4 to 1.5



Description:
This is closely related to JCR-1087

The call to checkLocalRevisionSchema() is too late because preapreStatements() already uses the LOCAL_REVISIONS table.

checkLocalRevisionSchema() should be called in checkSchema()
