Add option to ReverseStringFilter to mark reversed tokens



Description:
This patch implements additional functionality in the filter to "mark" reversed tokens with a special marker character (Unicode 0001). This is useful when indexing both straight and reversed tokens (e.g. to implement efficient leading wildcards search).
