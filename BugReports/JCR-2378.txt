Avoid exceptions thrown in finalize handler of RepositoryImpl constructor



Description:
If an exception happens during initialization of the repository, it might be overlayed by an exception thrown in the finalize handler of the RepositoryImpl constructor (see line 382 ff in [1]). The latter exception wins and the original exception is lost (if you don't have a log). This makes it hard to figure out the real problem.

This problem is actually a bit self-enforcing: if something goes wrong during startup, the code in the shutdown() method that is called is actually very prone to fail as it might not expect such a broken-startup state. In my case the overlaying NPE happened in ObservationManagerImpl.getRegisteredEventListeners, where this.dispatcher was unexpectedly null [2].

I think both places should be fixed (NPE guard in ObservationManagerImpl constructor for "dispatcher") and a try/catch block in the finalizer, just logging the exception:

    } finally {
        if (!succeeded) {
            try {
                // repository startup failed, clean up...
                shutdown();
            } catch (Throwable t) {
                // shutdown() likely to fail now, as startup was broken...
                log.error("In addition to startup fail, another problem occurred while shutting down the repository again.", e);
            }
        }
    }
