LockMethod.getResponseAsLockDiscovery() fails when status==201 



Description:
RFC 4918 Section 9.10.6 specifies that 201 is a valid response code for LOCK: "201 (Created) - The LOCK request was to an unmapped URL, the request succeeded and resulted in the creation of a new resource, and the value of the DAV:lockdiscovery property is included in the response body."

However, LockMethod.getResponseAsLockDiscovery() would fail in that scenario. 
    org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.DavException: Created

	 at org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav.client.methods.LockMethod.getResponseAsLockDiscovery(LockMethod.java:119)


The reason is in LockMethod:175 
      return statusCode == DavServletResponse.SC_OK;

Should be: 
      return statusCode == DavServletResponse.SC_OK
             || statusCode ==DavServletResponse.SC_CREATED;
