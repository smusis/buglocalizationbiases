NodeTypeManagerImpl.hasNodeType should allow unknown prefixes



Description:
The current implementation of NodeTypeImpl.hasNodeType(String) throws an exception if the given name uses an unknown prefix. A better alternative would be to just return false, as by definition a node type in an unknown namespace can not exist.
