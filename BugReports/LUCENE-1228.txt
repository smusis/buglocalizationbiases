IndexWriter.commit()  does not update the index version



Description:
IndexWriter.commit() can update the index *version* and *generation* but the update of *version* is lost.
As result added documents are not seen by IndexReader.reopen().
(There might be other side effects that I am not aware of).
The fix is 1 line - update also the version in SegmentsInfo.updateGeneration().
(Finding this line involved more lines though... :-) )
