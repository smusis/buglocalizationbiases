Speedup merging of stored fields when field mapping "matches"



Description:
Robert Engels suggested the following idea, here:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/54217

When merging in the stored fields from a segment, if the field name ->
number mapping is identical then we can simply bulk copy the entire
entry for the document rather than re-interpreting and then re-writing
the actual stored fields.

I've pulled the code from the above thread and got it working on the
current trunk.
