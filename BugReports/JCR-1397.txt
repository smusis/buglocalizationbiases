Allow query results with unknown size



Description:
To further optimize certain queries the query implementation should be changed to allow for unknown result sizes. Currently there is only one query ( //* ) where the query result returns an unknown size and a special query result implementation is returned. At the same time, this should be fixed that only one implementation is used.
