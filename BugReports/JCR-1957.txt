Move common validation checks to a single place



Description:
check for effective locks, nodes being checked-in, protection of item definitions etc. are abundant throughout jackrabbit-core. now that in addition retention and holds will be added and need to be checked as well, i suggest to move those checks to a common utility class and pass item and a list of checks to be performed.

batcheditemoperations already provides a similar pattern for the operations on item states.
i therefore suggest to move the flags to its base (ItemValidator) and add the utility methods needed.
