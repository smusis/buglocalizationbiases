Logging documentation refers to nonexisting level ERROR in java.util.logging section



Description:
Page "Logging Practices"  Section "java.util.logging Examples" 
(http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client/logging.html) 
says:
"org.apache.http.level = FINEST
org.apache.http.wire.level = ERROR"

However, there is no such thing as java.util.logging.Level.ERROR

Did you mean SEVERE as in
Logger.getLogger("org.apache.http.wire").setLevel(Level.SEVERE);

Thanks
