Benchmark alg line -  {[AddDoc(4000)]: 4} : * - causes an infinite loop



Description:
Background in http://www.mail-archive.com/java-dev@lucene.apache.org/msg10831.html 
The line  
   {[AddDoc(4000)]: 4} : * 
causes an infinite loop because the parallel sequence would mask the exhaustion from the outer sequential sequence.

To fix this the DocMaker exhaustion check should be modified to rely  on the doc maker instance only, and to be reset when the inputs are being reset.
