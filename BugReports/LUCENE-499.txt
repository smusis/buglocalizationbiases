Documentation improvements for 1.9 release



Description:
I've poked arround the 1.9-rc1 builds and noticed a few simple documentation things that could be cleaned up, a patch will follow that...

1) Adds some additional info to the README.txt
2) Updates the version info in queryparsersyntax.xml and fileformats.html, and advises people 
     with older versions how to find the correct documentation for their version
3) Builds javadocs for all of the contrib modules (the list was incomplete)
