corrupted paths after moving nodes



Description:
we just found a bug which corrupts the results of Node.getPath() - it seems to be related to older Jackrabbit bugs (e.g. JCR-768) but still happens in jackrabbit 1.3 and jackrabbit-1.4-SNAPSHOT

Basically we have a node with 3 subnodes (a, b, c), we move all of them to index 1 - this works fine, unless we call getPath() of the third Node before moving it.

The expected paths after moving would be:
a: /pages[37]/page/element[3]
b: /pages[37]/page/element[2]
c: /pages[37]/page/element

But we get these paths:

a: /pages[37]/page/element[3]
b: /pages[37]/page/element
c: /pages[37]/page/element
