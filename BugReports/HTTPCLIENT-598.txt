ContentLengthInputStream does not implement available() properly



Description:
ContentLengthInputStream should either extend FilterInputStream or should delegate available() to wrappedStream.

Otherwise, available() on the response stream (an instance of AutoCloseInputStream, which is properly extending FilterInputStream, and, therefore, delegating to the ContentLengthInputStream) always returns 0.

This issue is important for the clients that try to improve performance by processing all data that can be read in a non-blocking way before blocking on the network.
