TCK: NodeOrderableChildNodesTest tests node order even if node type doesn't support child node ordering



Description:
NodeOrderableChildNodesTest# testOrderBeforeUnsupportedRepositoryOperationException

This test calls prepareTest, which requires getNodes() to return the child nodes in the order added, even if the node type doesn't support child node ordering.  JSR-170 (Section 4.4.2) imposes no such requirement.

Proposal: do not check child node order in this test case.
