wrong assumptions in test cases about lock tokens



Description:
Several test cases assume that Lock.getLockToken has to return null for locks not attached to the current session. However, this is optional. Citing the Javadoc for getLockToken:

     * May return the lock token for this lock. If this lock is open-scoped and
     * the current session either holds the lock token for this lock, or the
     * repository chooses to expose the lock token to the current session, then
     * this method will return that lock token. Otherwise this method will
     * return <code>null</code>.
