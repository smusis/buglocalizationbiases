The repository-1.5.dtd is not well formed



Description:
The repository-1.5.dtd file at http://jackrabbit.apache.org/dtd/repository-1.5.dtd
is not well formed at the time of this writing 200/05/23 19:30GMT

1. It looks like a #REQUIRED is missing at line 173
2. Detected this while trying the 5minutes with ocm tutorial

Hope this helps,
 S.
