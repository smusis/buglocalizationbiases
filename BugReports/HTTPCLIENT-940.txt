impl.conn.Wire uses String.getBytes() which depends on the default charset



Description:
impl.conn.Wire uses String.getBytes() which depends on the default charset

The methods 
public void output(final String s)
and
public void input(final String s)

could probably be recoded to avoid this problem, as the output routine uses a StringBuilder.
