Minor spi2dav ExceptionConverter improvements



Description:
It would be nice if the ExceptionConverter class in spi2dav returned UnsupportedRepositoryOperationExceptions instead of the undeclared UnsupportedOperationExceptions for HTTP 501 responses.

Besides that, the ExceptionConverter.generate() methods should be cleaned to always return the generated exception instead of in some cases returning and in others throwing it.

Finally, there's some unused code and chances for Java 5 cleanups.

I'll attach a patch, and commit it unless anyone objects.
