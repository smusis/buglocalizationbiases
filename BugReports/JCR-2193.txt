builtin_nodetypes.cnd contains non-ascii chars and is not correctly decoded using websphere



Description:

I quickly checked the file and it contains some non ascii-7 characters. actually it should be stored, packaged and read as utf8. somthing was list in translation.
the simplest fix would be to remove all non-ascii7 characters from the file.
