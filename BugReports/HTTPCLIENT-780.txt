ProxyHost/HttpHost: Checks for null when javadoc document null ok



Description:
The constructor javadocs for ProxyHost and HttpHost all state that null is an allowed value - but there's an check in the HttpHost constructor for this which throws IllegalArgumentException.

(Actually allowing null as documented would also allow for a spring wiring remaining the same when using a proxy or not - steering the values from a propertyfile.)
