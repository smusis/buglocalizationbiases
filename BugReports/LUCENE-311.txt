[PATCH] queryParser.setOperator(int) should be made typesafe



Description:
There are AND and DEFAULT_OPERATOR_AND in QueryParser, so calling 
setOperator(QueryParser.AND) looks okay and compiles, but it's not correct. 
I'll attach a patch that uses a typesafe enum to avoid this problem. As 
there's also a getOperator method I had to change the name of the new method 
to get/setDefaultOperator. I don't like that, but it seems to be the only way 
to avoid compile errors for people who switch to a new version of Lucene. 
 
Okay to commit?
