make it easier to access default stopwords for language analyzers



Description:
DM Smith made the following comment: (sometimes it is hard to dig out the stop set from the analyzers)

Looking around, some of these analyzers have very different ways of storing the default list.
One idea is to consider generalizing something like what Simon did with LUCENE-1965, LUCENE-1962,
and having all stopwords lists stored as .txt files in resources folder.

{code}
  /**
   * Returns an unmodifiable instance of the default stop-words set.
   * @return an unmodifiable instance of the default stop-words set.
   */
  public static Set<String> getDefaultStopSet()
{code}
