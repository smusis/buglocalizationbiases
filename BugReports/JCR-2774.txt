Access control for repository level API operations



Description:
it is a open issue (i guess since jackrabbit 1.0) that the repository level write operations lack any kind of permission check.
this issues has been raised during specification of jsr 283 [1] but didn't made it into the specification (left to implementation).

in jackrabbit 2.0 this affects the following parts of the API

- namespace registration
- node type registration
- workspace creation/removal

based on a issue reported by david ("currently an anonymous user can write the namespace registry which is probably
undesirable [...]"), we could at least add some minimal restrictions. In addition i would like to take up this discussion
for jsr 333.
