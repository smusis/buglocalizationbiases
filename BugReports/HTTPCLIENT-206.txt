URI class constructors need revision, optimization



Description:
1. Currently there's not way to pass an escaped string as a parameter to URI
class. As a result the url parameter in HttpMethodBase#HttpMethodBase(String)
constructor gets converted into an array of char just to be converted back to
string in URI contructor called in that method. 

2. The overall design of URI class contructors does not appear very coherent (at
least to me)
