incorrect definition of built-in node type nt:hierarchyNode



Description:
the property jcr:created of nt:hierarchyNode should be non-mandatory according to the specification (jcr 1.0 and jcr 1.0.1).
both the definition of the built-in node type and the related test case should be fixed accordingly.
