If you "flush by RAM usage" then IndexWriter may over-merge



Description:
I think a good way to maximize performance of Lucene's indexing for a
given amount of RAM is to flush (writer.flush()) the added documents
whenever the RAM usage (writer.ramSizeInBytes()) has crossed the max
RAM you can afford.

But, this can confuse the merge policy and cause over-merging, unless
you set maxBufferedDocs properly.

This is because the merge policy looks at the current maxBufferedDocs
to figure out which segments are level 0 (first flushed) or level 1
(merged from <mergeFactor> level 0 segments).

I'm not sure how to fix this.  Maybe we can look at net size (bytes)
of a segment and "infer" level from this?  Still we would have to be
resilient to the application suddenly increasing the RAM allowed.

The good news is to workaround this bug I think you just need to
ensure that your maxBufferedDocs is less than mergeFactor *
typical-number-of-docs-flushed.
