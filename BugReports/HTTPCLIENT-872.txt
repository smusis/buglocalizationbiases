Add preemptive authentication



Description:
Wishlist request for preemptive authentication to be included in the API, like HttpClient 3.x had.  There is an example ClientPreemptiveBasicAuthentication.java that uses HttpRequestInterceptor which I had adapted to my application and it works fine.
