DBFileSystem MySQL DDL not compatible with pre-5.0 versions



Description:
The packaged ddl for mysql index sizes is too large for 4.x versions of MySQL. As the sum-total of the index sizes may only reach 500.

So, 

create unique index ${schemaObjectPrefix}FSENTRY_IDX on ${schemaObjectPrefix}FSENTRY (FSENTRY_PATH(745), FSENTRY_NAME)

will not work. I would suggest shortening the FSENTRY_PATH index value to 245, as FSENTRY_NAME is already set to 255.

create unique index ${schemaObjectPrefix}FSENTRY_IDX on ${schemaObjectPrefix}FSENTRY (FSENTRY_PATH(245), FSENTRY_NAME)
