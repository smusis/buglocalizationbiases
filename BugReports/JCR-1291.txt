Missing class JNDIDatabaseJournal



Description:
We're dealing to set up a clustered repository and run into some issues and missing features stated to be fixed in the upcoming v1.4. But while scanning the sources of the v1.4-rc1, i still can't find the class

  JNDIDatabaseJournal (org.apache.jackrabbit.core.journal.JNDIDatabaseJournal)

as a silbing to the classes 

  JNDIDatabaseFileSystem (org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.JNDIDatabaseFileSystem)

and 

  JNDIDatabasePersistenceManager (org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.db.JNDIDatabasePersistenceManager)

The missing one you'll need to configure all parts of a repository handeled in an abstract way by (e.g one common) JNDI database resource. From the shortness and simplicity of the source code of the other ones, i think adding this missing feature takes just about an hour.

Thank you for support
