TermVectors index files can become corrupt when autoCommit=false



Description:
Spinoff from this thread:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/55951

There are actually 2 separate cases here, both only happening when
autoCommit=false:

  * First issue was caused by LUCENE-843 (sigh): if you add a bunch of
    docs with no term vectors, such that 1 or more flushes happen;
    then you add docs that do have term vectors, the tvx file will not
    have enough entries (= corruption).

  * Second issue was caused by bulk merging of term vectors
    (LUCENE-1120 -- only in trunk) and bulk merging of stored fields
    (LUCENE-1043, in 2.3), and only shows when autoCommit=false, and,
    the bulk merging optimization runs.  In this case, the code that
    reads the rawDocs tries to read too far in the tvx/fdx files (it's
    not really index corruption but rather a bug in the rawDocs
    reading).
