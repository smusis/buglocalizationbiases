Repository lock file is not removed on shutdown



Description:
The repository lock file is not removed when Jackrabbit runs on a windows platform:

*ERROR* [Thread-4] RepositoryImpl: Unable to release repository lock (RepositoryImpl.java, line 283)

I assume this problem does not occur on unix based platforms, because they allow to delete a file while another process still uses it.
