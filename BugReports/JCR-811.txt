SetPropertyAssumeTypeTest check for non-protected string array property



Description:
SetPropertyAssumeTypeTest.testValuesConstraintViolationExceptionBecauseOfInvalidTypeParameter tries to find a property definition for a writable, multivalued string property. It consults NodeTypeUtil.locatePropertyDef() for that purpose.

In my setup, the property definition being returned is for jcr:valueConstraints, defined on nt:propertyDefinition. Nodes of that type in turn can not be created on the test node, thus the test fails already when trying to create the node.

It seems the test suite tries to be too smart here. Can we change this so that the node type and the property name are configuration parameters?
