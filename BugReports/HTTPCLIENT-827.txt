ServerTestBase, LocalTestServer should be redistributed



Description:
ServerTestBase and LocalTestServer should be redistributed, so that we can all benefit from these wonderful classes without having to copy / paste them.

For instance, I am currently creating a REST client for some web service, and I would totally benefit from your classes to check borderline cases (404, 500, etc..)

the simplest possible way to achieve this would be to add a maven-jar-plugin entry to the POM that executes the test-jar goal.
