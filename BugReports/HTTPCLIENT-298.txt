javadoc often has <code> without </code>



Description:
Just to mention it:
there are a lot of javadoc comments that read like
 <tt>false</ff> otherwise.
which prints the rest of the document in <tt>
can't give a complete list, it happens very often.
To check, just go to the bottom of a page and see if it appears in <tt> or 
<code>
