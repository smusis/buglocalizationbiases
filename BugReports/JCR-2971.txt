Revert subsequent token-node updates (tentatively introduced)



Description:
i would like to revert this improvement has been tentatively introduced based on the following
thread on the dev list: http://www.mail-archive.com/dev@jackrabbit.apache.org/msg24437.html
as i am still concerned about undesired effects. in addition i still feel that this somehow
violates the basic contract.
