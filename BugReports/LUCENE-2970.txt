SpecialOperations.isFinite can have TERRIBLE TERRIBLE runtime in certain situations



Description:
in an application of mine, i experienced some very slow query times with finite automata (all the DFAs are acyclic)

It turned out, the slowdown is some terrible runtime in SpecialOperations.isFinite <-- this is used to determine if the DFA is acyclic or not.

(in this case I am talking about even up to minutes of cpu).
