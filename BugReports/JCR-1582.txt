Parameters 'idleTime' and 'queryClass' cause QueryHandler to fail



Description:
This issue does not occur in a released jackrabbit-core version. With the changes from JCR-1462 jackrabbit now fails to startup if there is an unknown parameter in a bean configuration.

The parameters 'idleTime' and 'queryClass' are not used by the QueryHandler but by the SearchManager, which instantiates the QueryHandler. Therefore the parameters do not show up in the QueryHandler.

I suggest we introduce them in the common base class AbstractQueryHandler.
