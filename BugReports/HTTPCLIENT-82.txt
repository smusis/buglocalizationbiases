HttpURLConnection wrapper



Description:
Initial comments from Vincent Massol for this feature:

I am moving Jakarta Cactus from using the JDK HttpURLConnection to
Commons HttpClient. However, I have some public interface that return
HttpURLConnection and I cannot break that contract with Cactus users.

I propose to write a HttpURLConnection wrapper for HttpMethod (I have
actually already written it but I am currently testing it on Cactus and
will make a proper donation once I am sure it works - i.e all the Cactus
tests pass as before ... ).

I attach a preview of it for those interested.

What do you think of including it in HttpClient distribution ?

Thanks
-Vincent
