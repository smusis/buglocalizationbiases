SegmentReader.getFieldNames ignores FieldOption.DOC_VALUES



Description:
we use this getFieldNames api in segmentmerger if we merge something that isn't a SegmentReader (e.g. FilterIndexReader)

it looks to me that if you use a FilterIndexReader, call addIndexes(Reader...) the docvalues will be simply dropped.

I dont think its enough to just note that the field has docvalues either right? We need to also set the type 
correctly in the merged field infos? This would imply that instead of FieldOption.DOCVALUES, we need to have a 
FieldOption for each ValueType so that we correctly update the type.

But looking at FI.update/setDocValues, it doesn't look like we 'type-promote' here anyway?
