Make it easier to run Test2BTerms



Description:
Currently, Test2BTerms has an @Ignore annotation which means that the only way to run it as a test is to edit the file.

There are a couple of options to fix this:
# Add a main() so it can be invoked via the command line outside of the test framework
# Add some new annotations that mark it as slow or weekly or something like that and have the test target ignore @slow (or whatever) by default, but can also turn it on.
