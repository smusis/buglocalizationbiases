add spanquery support for all multitermqueries



Description:
I set fix version: 4.0, but possibly we could do this for 3.x too

Currently, we have a special SpanRegexQuery in contrib, and issues like LUCENE-522 open for SpanFuzzyQuery.
The SpanRegexQuery in contrib is a little messy additionally.

For any arbitrary MultiTermQueries to work as a SpanQuery, there are only 3 requirements:
# The un-rewritten query must extend SpanQuery so it can be included in Span clauses
# The rewritten query should be SpanOrQuery instead of BooleanQuery
# The rewritten term clauses should be SpanTermQueries.

Instead of having logic like this for each query, i suggest adding two rewrite methods:
* ScoringSpanBoolean rewrite
* TopTermsSpanBoolean rewrite

as a start i wrote these up, and added a SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper that can be used to wrap any multitermquery this way.
there are a few kinks, but I think the MTQ policeman can probably help get through them.
