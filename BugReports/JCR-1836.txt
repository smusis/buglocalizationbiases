Persistence: support property databaseType



Description:
In persistence managers and cluster journal the term 'schema' is used to mean 'database type'. 

Using the term 'schema' for that is actually quite confusing (in my view):

The definition of schema http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_schema is "the schema defines the tables, the fields in each table, and the relationships between fields and tables."

Additionally in most databases a schema is is a name space within a database: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/sql/DatabaseMetaData.html#getSchemas() .

I suggest to support the property 'databaseType' in addition to 'schema' for the persistence managers and the cluster journal.
