Extend mimetype list of text extractors



Description:
Do you think it would be possible to extend the mimetype list of the
MsPowerpoint and MsExcel textextractors with "application/powerpoint" and
"application/excel"? 

It just took me half an hour to figure out why my
documents didn't turn up in a jackrabbit fulltext-search and maybe other
users might run into the same problem...

I'm not sure if there is some kind of standard which lists the possible
default mimetypes but after a quick google search it seems to me that they
are not that uncommon.
