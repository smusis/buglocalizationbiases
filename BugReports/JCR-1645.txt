Add support for Map of referenced beans



Description:
OCM should support the mapping of maps of referenced beans.

@Collection(collectionConverter= BeanReferenceCollectionConverterImpl.class)
private java.util.Map<String, ReferencedBean> aMap;

BeanReferenceCollectionConverterImpl (mainly the method doGetCollection) needs to be updated to support the interface ManageableMap interface.
