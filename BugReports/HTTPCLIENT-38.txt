Header Connection Close - Closes the Connection



Description:
If the connectionHeader equals Close the conection imediateley closes, without 
waiting for the responce back from the server. 

If the client is pulling data from a CGI script which has not sent the Content 
Length - most servers will send a Connection Close header. For example 

-----------------------------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 21 Jun 2002 17:08:46 GMT
Server: Apache/1.3.14 (Unix)
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
 
<html>
      <head>
            <title>thegumtree.com - London's online community for Aussies, Kiwis
 and South Africans</title>
                           <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; c
harset=iso-8859-1">
                   </head>

--------------------------------

I do not yet have a work arround apart from commenting out the the following 
code in 

Header connectionHeader = getResponseHeader("connection"); etc

in HttpMethodBase
