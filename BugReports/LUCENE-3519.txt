BlockJoinCollector only allows retrieving groups for only one BlockJoinQuery



Description:
Spinoff from Mark Harwood's email (subject "BlockJoin concerns") to
dev list.

It's fine to use multiple nested joins in a single query, and
BlockJoinCollector should let you retrieve the top groups for all of
them.

But currently it always returns null after the first query's groups
have been retrieved, because of a silly bug.
