Revise Weight#scorer & Filter#getDocIdSet API to pass Readers context



Description:
Spinoff from LUCENE-2694 - instead of passing a reader into Weight#scorer(IR, boolean, boolean) we should / could revise the API and pass in a struct that has parent reader, sub reader, ord of that sub. The ord mapping plus the context with its parent would make several issues way easier. See LUCENE-2694, LUCENE-2348 and LUCENE-2829 to name some.
