Allow easy extension of RAMDirectory



Description:
RAMDirectory uses RAMFiles to store the data. RAMFile offers a newBuffer() method for extensions to override and allocate buffers differently, from e.g. a pool or something. However, RAMDirectory always allocates RAMFile and doesn't allow allocating a RAMFile extension, which makes RAMFile.newBuffer() unusable.

I think we can simply introduce a newRAMFile() method on RAMDirectory and make the RAMFiles map protected, and it will allow really extending RAMDir.

I will post a patch later.
