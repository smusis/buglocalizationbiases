Jcr-Server: ValuesProperty missing property type information



Description:
JCR specific dav-property ValuesProperty does not reveal the PropertyType of the value, which is therefore lost during (de)serialization. 

Solution: 
- Pass type of the JCR-value as attribute to the xml-element containing the value.
