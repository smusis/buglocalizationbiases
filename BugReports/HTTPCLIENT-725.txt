TSCCM code cleanup



Description:
The ThreadSafeClientConnectionManager, or rather it's ConnPoolByRoute, needs plenty of cleanup.
- use long + TimeUnit for timeout intervals (Java 5 style)
- compute timeout end date once instead of remaining interval
- review which methods should acquire the pool lock,
  and which should expect the caller to have done that
- use factory methods to instantiate some of the helper objects
