make the build more friendly to apache harmony



Description:
as part of improved testing, i thought it would be a good idea to make the build (ant test) more friendly
to working under apache harmony.

i'm not suggesting we de-optimize code for sun jvms or anything crazy like that, only use it as a tool.

for example:
* bugs in tests/code: for example i found a test that expected ArrayIOOBE 
  when really the javadoc contract for the method is just IOOBE... it just happens to
  pass always on sun jvm because thats the implementation it always throws.
* better reproduction of bugs: for example [2 months out of the year|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unusual_software_bug#Phase_of_the_Moon_bug]
  it seems TestQueryParser fails with thai locale in a difficult-to-reproduce way.
  but i *always* get similar failures like this with harmony for this test class.
* better stability and portability: we should try (if reasonable) to avoid depending
  upon internal details. the same kinds of things that fail in harmony might suddenly
  fail in a future sun jdk. because its such a different impl, it brings out a lot of interesting stuff.

at the moment there are currently a lot of failures, I think a lot might be caused by this: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.harmony.devel/39484
