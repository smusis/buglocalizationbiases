Better integration of the TestWebApp-HowTo into the documentation



Description:
The excellent webapp howto written by Olegolas needs to be integrated better
into httpclient documentation.  Currently it is in the docs directory as a html
file, but it would be better if it was in the xdocs directory as an xml file.
