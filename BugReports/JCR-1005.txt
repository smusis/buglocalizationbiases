More Fine grained Permission Flags



Description:
It would be fine to have one more Permission Flag on node add.
At the moment there are 3 flags. We need to know if a node will be updated or created.
This is not possible with the current implementation because on node add the permission flag 
AccessManager.WRITE will be used. This is a Problem in a  WebDav Scenario with Microsoft-Word because if i open a Node and 
try to save it i need write permissions on the parent node. this is ok. If a user trys to save the file with a other name
he can because the same PermissionFlag will be used.
Maybe there is a other solution for this problem ?
