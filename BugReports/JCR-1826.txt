Change default value of SearchIndex extractorPoolSize



Description:
The current default value for the extractorPoolSize is 0, which means it is disabled by default. I think we should change that default because it is a useful feature and people should not have to dig through documentation to make use of it.

The new default should be computed based on the available processors. I suggest we use: 2 * Runtime.availableProcessors()
