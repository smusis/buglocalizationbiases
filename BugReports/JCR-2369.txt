Problem importing node with binary property in a repository configured with datastore



Description:
Using the importXML method of workspace to import some node containing binary properties the nodes are imported correctly and the value of the binary data property is imported
However the binary data goes to the db (persistenceManager) an not to the datastore.

Creating a new node of the same type using the api, the binary data go to the datastore.
