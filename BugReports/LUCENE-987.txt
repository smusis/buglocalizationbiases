See discussion at http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/52017?search_string=deprecating%20indexmodifier;#52017

This is to deprecate IndexModifier before 3.0 and remove it in 3.0.

This patch includes:
  1 IndexModifier and TestIndexModifier are deprecated.
  2 TestIndexWriterModify is added. It is similar to TestIndexModifer but uses IndexWriter and has a few other changes. The changes are because of the difference between IndexModifier and IndexWriter.
  3 TestIndexWriterLockRelease and TestStressIndexing are switched to use IndexWriter instead of IndexModifier.
