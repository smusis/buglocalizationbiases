o.a.j.spi.commons.query.sql2.ParserTest uses platform encoding with non-ASCII characters



Description:
The ParserTest class loads a series of test SQL statements from test.sql2.txt, which contains a few non-ASCII characters (good to test those!). Unfortunately the file is read using the default platform encoding, which breaks the Linux-based test builds.

I'll recode the file to UTF-8 and explicitly specify the encoding when the file is read.
