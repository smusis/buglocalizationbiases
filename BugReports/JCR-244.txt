Support contains queries with wildcard prefix



Description:
The current implementation only allows wildcards in the middle or at the end of a search term. 

The following queries work right now:
//*[jcr:contains(., 'foo*')
//*[jcr:contains(., 'fo?o')

But the following does not:
//*[jcr:contains(., '*bar')

There was already a thread in the mailing list on this topic:
