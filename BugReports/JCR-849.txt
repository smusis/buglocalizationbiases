Bundle persistence name index not case-sensitive in MySQL and MS SQL



Description:
As reported by Martijn Hendriks on the dev mailing list (see http://www.nabble.com/Bundle-persistence-managers---db-collation-tf3571522.html), the NAME column of the NAMES table in the bundle persistence manager needs to be case-sensitive.
