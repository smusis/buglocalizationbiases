don't spawn thread statically in FSDirectory on Mac OS X



Description:
on the Mac, creating the digester starts up a PKCS11 thread.

I do not think threads should be created statically (I have this same issue with TimeLimitedCollector and also FilterManager).

Uwe discussed removing this md5 digester, I don't care if we remove it or not, just as long as it doesn't create a thread,
and just as long as it doesn't use the system default locale.
