Upgrade to Logback 1.0



Description:
Logback 1.0 was just released (see http://mailman.qos.ch/pipermail/announce/2011/000093.html). There are no big new features or other major changes, but the bump to 1.0 is still a good point for us to upgrade to get all the latest bug fixes and other improvements.

At the same time we should upgrade our SLF4J depedency to the latest 1.6.4 version.
