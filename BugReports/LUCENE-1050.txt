SimpleFSLockFactory ignores error on deleting the lock file



Description:
Spinoff from here:

    http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/54438

The Lock.release for SimpleFSLockFactory ignores the return value of lockFile.delete().  I plan to throw a new LockReleaseFailedException, subclassing from IOException, when this returns false.  This is a very minor change to backwards compatibility because all methods in Lucene that release a lock already throw IOException.
