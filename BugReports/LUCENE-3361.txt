port url+email tokenizer to standardtokenizerinterface (or similar)



Description:
We should do this so that we can fix the LUCENE-3358 bug there, and preserve backwards.
We also want this mechanism anyway, for upgrading to new unicode versions in the future.

We can regenerate the new TLD list for 3.4 but, we should ensure the existing one is used for the urlemail33 or whatever,
so that its exactly the same.
