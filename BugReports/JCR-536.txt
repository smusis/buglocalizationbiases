Session leak in API test cases



Description:
In setUp(). AbstractPropertyTest checks whether it can execute the test and potentially throws an NotExecutableException. In this case, the helper Session is lost (without logging out), and the parent's tearDown() code isn't executed. 

The same problem may be present in more test classes (will check).
