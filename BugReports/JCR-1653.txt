NodeIdImpl is not really serializable 



Description:
I've been trying to get jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr to work. 

The error I'm seeing is reported as:
java.io.NotSerializableException: org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.commons.identifier.IdFactoryImpl

I believe I tracked this down.  It is because NodeIdImpl is implicitly referencing its containing instance IdFactoryImpl which is not serializable.

NodeIdImpl is attempted to be serialized, in my case, with the following stack:

at org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.rmi.client.ClientRepositoryService.getItemInfos(ClientRepositoryService.java:258)
at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.state.WorkspaceItemStateFactory.createNodeState(WorkspaceItemStateFactory.java:94)
at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.state.TransientISFactory.createNodeState(TransientISFactory.java:99)
at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.hierarchy.NodeEntryImpl.doResolve(NodeEntryImpl.java:972)
at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.hierarchy.HierarchyEntryImpl.resolve(HierarchyEntryImpl.java:95)
at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.hierarchy.HierarchyEntryImpl.getItemState(HierarchyEntryImpl.java:212)
at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.ItemManagerImpl.getItem(ItemManagerImpl.java:170)
at org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.SessionImpl.getRootNode(SessionImpl.java:216)

I think I must be doing something wrong, because it seems like this is a fundamental problem with doing jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr, and looking at the SVN history I don't see how this ever could have worked.  
So either session.getRootNode() has never been tested using jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr, or I've got something setup wrong.
