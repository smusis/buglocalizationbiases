Remove query handler idleTime



Description:
The changes included in JCR-415 revealed a synchronization issue with the query handler idle timer task.

See thread on dev-list: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.jackrabbit.devel/10199

We could either fix the synchronization issue in the SearchManager class or remove the functionality all together.

Because the repository also supports a idle time parameter for the whole workspace (maxIdleTime in Workspaces element) the query handler idle time should be removed.
