Journal log file rotation overwrites old files



Description:
Journal log files are rotated as follows:

  journal.log.N -> journal.log.(N+1)

Because the list of files to be rotated is created with alphanumeric sort order
(descending), it may destroy files in the following situation:

  journal.log.9  -> journal.log.10
  ..
  journal.log.2  -> journal.log.3
  journal.log.10 -> journal.log.11 (!)
  journal.log.1  -> journal.log.2

i.e. journal.log.10 is overwritten by journal.log.9 and then moved.
