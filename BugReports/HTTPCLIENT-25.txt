[httpclient] Incorrect credentials loop infinitely



Description:
If incorrect credentials are assigned to the request, HttpClient will loop 
forever.  It should only try once, and fail with an HttpException if a request 
with credentials set fails.

In org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.execute(), a check is needed to 
track if credentials have been sent before.
