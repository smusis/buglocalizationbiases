Text extractor classes are obsolete in web



Description:
Text extractor classes are obsolete in http://jackrabbit.apache.org/doc/components/index-filters.html

"org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query" are actually "org.apache.jackrabbit.extractor"

Plain text extractor continue being "org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.TextPlainTextFilter"?
