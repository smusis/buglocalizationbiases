[PATCH] small fixes to the new scoring.html doc



Description:
This is an awesome initiative.  We need more docs that cleanly explain the inner workings of Lucene in general... thanks Grant & Steve & others!

I have a few small initial proposed fixes, largely just adding some more description around the components of the formula.  But also a couple typos, another link out to Wikipedia, a missing closing ), etc.  I've only made it through the "Understanding the Scoring Formula" section so far.
