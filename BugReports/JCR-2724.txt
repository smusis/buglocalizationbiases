Wrong argument check in BTreeManager constructor



Description:
In the constructor of BTreeManager the argument check on maxChildren and minChildren is wrong. Instead of

        if (2 * minChildren < maxChildren) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("maxChildren must be at least twice minChildren");
        }

it should be

        if (2 * minChildren > maxChildren) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("maxChildren must be at least twice minChildren");
        }
