 MalformedCookieException: distinguish cookie syntax errors from cross-domain errors



Description:
MalformedCookieException is used for both cookies with syntax errors,
and for cookies which are invalid for the particular context - e.g.
cross-domain cookies.

I think it would be helpful to be able to distinguish these without
needing to examine the message text.
