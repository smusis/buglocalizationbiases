GData TestDateFormater (sic) fails when the Date returned is: Sun, 23 Sep 2007 01:29:06 GMT+00:00



Description:
TestDateFormater.testFormatDate fails when the Date returned is Sun, 23 Sep 2007 01:29:06 GMT+00:00

The issue lies with the +00:00 at the end of the string.  

The question is, though, is that a valid date for GData?

This is marked as major b/c it is causing nightly builds to fail.
