Command line access to remote repositories



Description:
A few years ago Edgar Poce implemented a nice command line JCR access tool called jcr-commands. We haven't really been using it much and the code is currently parked in sandbox/inactive.

I'd like to resurrect this codebase and integrate it to jackrabbit-standalone to implement command line access to remote repositories. The idea would be to have an easy-to-use tool for simple testing and administration tasks.
