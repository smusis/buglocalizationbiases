Make StopFilter.enablePositionIncrements explicit



Description:
I think the default for this should be true, ie, do not lose
information when filtering (preserve the positions of the original
tokens).

But, we can't change this without breaking back-compat.

So, as workaround, we should make the parameter explicit so one must
decide up front.
