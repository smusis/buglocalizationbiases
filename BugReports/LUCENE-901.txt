DefaultSimilarity.queryNorm() should never return Infinity



Description:
Currently DefaultSimilarity.queryNorm() returns Infinity if sumOfSquaredWeights=0.
This can result in a score of NaN (e. g. in TermScorer) if boost=0.0f.

A simple fix would be to return 1.0f in case zero is passed in.

See LUCENE-698 for discussions about this.
