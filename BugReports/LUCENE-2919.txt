IndexSplitter that divides by primary key term



Description:
Index splitter that divides by primary key term.  The contrib MultiPassIndexSplitter we have divides by docid, however to guarantee external constraints it's sometimes necessary to split by a primary key term id.  I think this implementation is a fairly trivial change.
