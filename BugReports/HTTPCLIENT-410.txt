Typos in MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager



Description:
I've done a review of the MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager class in 3.0-beta1,
especially focussing on the documentation. In general, it could use a lot of
improvement, IMHO.

This bug report only deals with some typos I found in the class, and some
minimal style improvements that are compatible with the other classes.

I will attach a proposed patch.
