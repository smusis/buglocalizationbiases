Remove lib directory from SVN trunk



Description:
build.xml expects to find junit.jar in the lib directory for building and running tests.

The jar is not included in SVN, but nor is the jar ignored, so when it is downloaded it shows up as an unversioned file.

The file should be included in or excluded from SVN.

==

Note: In JMeter we use a lib/opt directory.
This is present in SVN - but all contents are ignored.

This can be used for extra jars that cannot be or are not included in SVN.

Could use the same approach for junit.jar...
