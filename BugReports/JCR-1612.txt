Reintroduce NamespaceStorage



Description:
hi jukka

i open this issue as a reminder of our recent discussion in basel:

we decided that you will 
- reintroduce the NamespaceStorage you recently removed from jcr2spi
- reintroduce a namespace cache in jcr2spi (but using a simple map instead of NamespaceCache object)

in addition we agreed that we want to share the NamespaceRegistryImpl between jcr2spi and jackrabbit-core
and you volenteered to provide a patch for that.

thanks in advance
angela
