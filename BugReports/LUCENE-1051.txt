Separate javadocs for core and contribs



Description:
A while ago we had a discussion on java-dev about separating the javadocs
for the contrib modules instead of having only one big javadoc containing 
the core and contrib classes.

This patch:
* Adds new targets to build.xml: 
  ** "javadocs-all" Generates Javadocs for the core, demo, and contrib 
    classes
  ** "javadocs-core" Generates Javadocs for the core classes
  ** "javadocs-demo" Generates Javadocs for the demo classes
  ** "javadocs-contrib" Using contrib-crawl it generates the Javadocs for 
    all contrib modules, except "similarity" (currently empty) and gdata.
* Adds submenues to the Javadocs link on the Lucene site with links to
  the different javadocs
* Includes the javadocs in the maven artifacts

Remarks:
- I removed the ant target "javadocs-internal", because I didn't want to
  add corresponding targets for all new javadocs target. Instead I 
  defined a new property "javadoc.access", so now  
  "ant -Djavadoc.access=package" can be used in combination with any of
  the javadocs targets. Is this ok?
- I didn't include gdata (yet) because it uses build files that don't 
  extend Lucenes standard build files.
