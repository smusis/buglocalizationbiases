remove contrib/misc and contrib/wordnet's dependencies on analyzers module



Description:
These contribs don't actually analyze any text.

After this patch, only the contrib/demo relies upon the analyzers module... we can separately try to figure that one out (I don't think any of these lucene contribs needs to reach back into modules/)
