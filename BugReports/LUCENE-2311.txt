Pass potent SR to IRWarmer.warm(), and also call warm() for new segments



Description:
Currently warm() receives a SegmentReader without terms index and docstores.
It would be arguably more useful for the app to receive a fully loaded reader, so it can actually fire up some caches. If the warmer is undefined on IW, we probably leave things as they are.

It is also arguably more concise and clear to call warm() on all newly created segments, so there is a single point of warming readers in NRT context, and every subreader coming from getReader is guaranteed to be warmed up -> you don't have to introduce even more mess in your code by rechecking it.
