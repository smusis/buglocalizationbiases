DateTools UTC/GMT mismatch



Description:
Post from Antony Bowesman on java-user:

I just noticed that although the Javadocs for Lucene 2.2 state that the dates 
for DateTools use UTC as a timezone, they are actually using GMT.

Should either the Javadocs be corrected or the code corrected to use UTC instead.

-----

I'm attaching a patch that changes the javadoc and will commit it, unless someone knows a reason the javadoc is correct and the code should be changed to UTC. To my understanding, there's no significant difference between UTC and GMT.
